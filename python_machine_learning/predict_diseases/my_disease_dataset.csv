Abdominal Pain,"Abdominal pain can be felt anywhere between thorax ( chest ) and pelvis.  Pain could be mild, moderate or severe. It may be dull or acute.,Almost everyone has experienced abdominal pain, one time or other.  Most of the time, stomach pain is not serious, but severe abdominal pain is a cause of concern.  If pain starts suddenly and unexpectedly, it should be regarded as an emergency, and investigated accordingly.,References: www.nhs.uk,www.nlm.nih.gov,www.nlm.nih.gov,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov","Pain in abdomen can be of various intensities and nature. It can be:,Sharp, stabbing cramp like pain,Brief pain that may come or go,Pain associated with vomiting,Reference: www.nhs.uk","Various conditions are associated with abdominal pain . Causes of abdominal pain include:,Constipation,Irritable bowel syndrome,Food allergy,Food poisoning,Menstrual pain,Sudden, severe abdominal pain:,Abdominal infection,Appendicitis,A perforated peptic ulcer,Gallstones,Kidney stones,Diverticulitis : Inflammation of small pouches that are part of the bowel,Other common causes in adults are:,Irritable bowel syndrome,Crohn's disease,Urinary tract infection,Long term Peptic ulcer,Constipation,Heartburn and acid reflux,Common Causes in children,Constipation,Urinary tract Infection,Anxiety,Heartburn and acid reflux,References:,www.nlm.nih.gov,www.nhs.uk","Generally abdominal pain goes with time, but if the pain does not subside, then one should seek medical help:,Abdominal discomfort that lasts 1 week or longer,Abdominal pain that does not improve in 24 - 48 hours, or becomes more severe and frequent and occurs with nausea and vomiting,Bloating that persists for more than 2 days,Burning sensation or increase in frequency on urination,Diarrhoea for more than 5 days,Fever (over 100°F for adults or 100.4°F for children) with pain,Prolonged poor appetite,Prolonged vaginal bleeding,Unexplained weight loss,Reference:  www.nlm.nih.gov","Generally, treatment for abdominal pain depends upon its cause.,Treatment usually is with medications for inflammation of Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or Ulcers,Use antibiotics in case of infections,Modify your eating habits,Surgical treatment is indicated in conditions like appendicitis  or hernia (inguinal and umbilical),Seek doctors advice before going in for any treatment.,Reference: www.nlm.nih.gov"
Alcohol Abuse And Alcoholism,"Alcoholism is a condition  when a person have signs of physical addiction to alcohol and continues to drink , despite problems with physical and psychological health. Alcohol abuse is when person's drinking habits leads to problems, but not physical addiction.",People who have alcoholism or alcohol abuse often:,,"The medical professional will perform a physical examination and ask questions about person's medical and family history, including use of alcohol.",Treating alcoholism depends on how much a person drinks. Further treatment options are:
Alopecia (Hair Loss),Partial or complete loss of hair is called alopecia. Hair loss usually develops gradually and may be patchy or diffuse (all over). One loses up to 100 hair from the scalp everyday.,,There are many reasons for hair loss.  It include following reasons:,"Dermatologists can diagnose hair loss by asking questions about medical history, family history. A dermatologist may also carefully look at the scalp  to know the condition of scalp.",Treatment of hair loss depends upon the cause of disease.
Anxiety,Anxiety is an unpleasant emotional state of uneasiness and distress. It is generally characterized by apprehension and worry. An anxiety disorder can have a devastating effect on the person. Most of the people go through this disease and end up in a depression.,Some of the symptoms include:,The exact reason for the anxiety is still not known.,It can be diagnosed by the signs and symptoms. Psychiatric evaluation helps in diagnosing the disease.,"Anxiety can be treated with psychiatric therapy, medication, or both."
Appendicitis,"Appendicitis is the swelling (inflammation) of the appendix. The appendix is a small, tube like organ attached to the large intestine. The condition is due to blockage inside the appendix. The blockage leads to increased pressure and inflammation. Appendicitis can occur at any age but it is more common during childhood and adolescence.",The main symptom is pain in abdomen. It is dull initially but gets worse over time.,"The exact reason for acute appendicitis is still unclear.  Although, it is associated with the blockage  inside the appendix. This blockage  can be due to small pieces of faeces, a foreign body or infection.","Diagnosis may include thorough physical examination and careful consideration of the symptoms. If the diagnosis is not clear, then laboratory tests and ultrasound or CT scans may be performed.","Treatment generally include  surgical removal of appendix.  This procedure is known as an appendicectomy or appendectomy. The appendix is removed using laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery. In this procedure, surgeon uses a slender instrument (laparoscope), which is inserted through tiny incisions (cuts) in the abdomen. This eliminates the need for an abdominal incision."
Autism,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a range of complex neurodevelopment disorders, characterized by social impairments, communication difficulties, and restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped pattern of behaviour. It is a brain disorder that typically affects a person's ability to communicate with others. ASD form of disease generally begins in childhood and last through adulthood.","ASDs generally begin at or before the age of 3 and last throughout a person's life, even though symptoms may improve over time. Most of the children with an ASD may exhibit hints of future problems within the first few months of life. While others, show symptoms until 24 months or later. Some children with an ASD seem to develop normally until around 18 to 24 months of age and then they stop gaining new skills, or they lose the skills they once had.","The exact reason for the causes of ASD is not known, but it’s likely to be associated to genetics and environment factors.  Number of genes have been identified that are associated with this disorder.","Diagnosis of  ASDs can be difficult as there is no medical test, like a blood test, to diagnose the disorder. Physician may look at the child’s behavior and development to make a diagnosis.","There is no cure for the disease. However, it can be managed with the help of medications and specialist education."
Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome,,,,"HIV test is done to detect human immunodeficiency virus in saliva, serum or urine. The UNAIDS/WHO policy statement on HIV Testing states that conditions under which people undergo HIV testing must be anchored in a human rights approach that pays due respect to ethical principles . According to these principles, the conduct of HIV testing of individuals must address:","Definitive cure for AIDS is yet to be discovered. However, some medicines, given at certain stage of the disease, depending upon CD4 count in the blood of the patient, can prolong life of HIV positive persons."
Alzheimer'S Disease,,"Forgetfulness,Language difficulties including difficulty in remembering names,Difficulty in planning and problem solving,Difficulty in doing previously familiar tasks,Difficulty in concentration,Difficulty in spatial relationships like remembering roads and routes to a particular destination,Difficulty in social behavior",Scientists have not yet understood the exact cause of Alzheimer's disease. It is postulated to have multifactorial etiology like:,"Early, accurate diagnosis is crucial for several reasons. It can tell people whether their symptoms are due to Alzheimer’s disease or another cause, such as stroke, tumour, Parkinson’s disease, sleep disturbances, side effects of medications, or other conditions that may be treatable and possibly reversible.","There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease; though symptomatic relief can be provided. Current treatments can be divided into Medical, Psychosocial and Care giving."
Anaemia,The condition of having a lower-than-normal number of red blood cells or quantity of hemoglobin.,The most common symptom of anaemia is fatigue or weakness.,Three main cause of anaemia are:,Medical History:,"Iron supplements:  The most commonly prescribed supplement is ferrous sulphate, taken orally (by mouth) two or three times a day."
Arthritis,Arthritis is a disease of joints (inflammation of joints). There are many types of arthritis.,"The commonest symptoms involve joints. Joint pain and stiffness is common feature along with swelling of joints.,Arthritic disorders like lupus and rheumatoid can also affect other organs in the body with a variety of symptoms.","When inflammation occurs, chemicals from the body are released into the blood or affected tissues. This release of chemicals increases the blood flow to the area of injury or infection and may result in redness and warmth. Some of the chemicals cause leakage of fluid into the tissues, resulting in swelling. This process may stimulate nerves and cause pain.","Physical Examination: It may show swollen, warm or red joints with restriction of movement.,Blood test: This is generally done for rheumatoid arthritis.,Rheumatoid factor (RF): It is checked for rheumatoid arthritis. However, RF can also be found in people without RA or with other autoimmune disorders. In general, if no rheumatoid factor is present in someone with RA, the course of the disease is less severe.,Levels of ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels: These are also increased. Both CRP and ESR levels are used to check disease activity and also to monitor how well someone is responding to treatment.,Imaging scans: Like X-ray, CT scans and MRI are commonly used to get the image of bones and cartilage to ascertain diagnosis.","Physical exercise: During pain, exercise seems to be the last option but  muscle strengthening and stretching exercises have proved to be very helpful.,To relieve pain: Pain relievers like NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs). NSAIDs generally interfere with chemicals called prostaglandins in the body, which trigger pain, inflammation, and fever. They are very helpful in relieving pain in all forms of arthritis.,Surgery: Joint replacement surgery is often performed for those who are not able to walk or have lot of difficulty in walking.,Disease-modifying anti rheumatic drugs (DMARDs): Often used to treat rheumatoid arthritis; DMARDs slow or stop immune system that attack joints. Examples include methotrexate (Trexall) and hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil).,Intra-articular injection: It is a procedure used in the treatment of inflammatory joint conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout, tendinitis, bursitis and occasionally osteoarthritis. A hypodermic needle is injected into the affected joint where it delivers a dose of any one of many anti-inflammatory agents, the most common of which are corticosteroids."
Asthma,,"Asthma symptoms can vary in severity with time, can come and go, there may be good and bad periods. Asthma is characterized by:",The exact cause of asthma is yet not known. But there are certain risk factors that are associated with asthma. It is probably caused by interplay of hereditary and environmental factors.,Medical History:  Doctor may also ask:,"Medications: Medicines in asthma is generally given through the inhaled route. “Metered dose” and “dry powder” inhalers are equally effective for long term use, the “nebulized” form being generally used during acute attacks. Inhaling a drug is an effective way of taking an asthma medicine as it goes straight to the lungs, with very little ending up elsewhere in the body. There are two types of inhaled medications. Since asthma is an inflammatory disease, preventer medication should not be discontinued without medical advice.,“Airway-opening medication or Quick-Relief” (Reliever) inhaler: The inhaler usually contains a short-acting beta 2-agonist. It works by relaxing the muscles surrounding the narrowed airways. Examples of reliever medicines include salbutamol, levo-salbutamol and terbutaline. They are utilized in stopping asthma attacks.,“Controller medication” (Preventer) inhaler: It works to reduce the amount of inflammation and ‘twitchiness’ in the airways and prevent asthma attacks occurring. Examples of preventer inhalers are beclomethasone, budesonide, fluticasone and mometasone; often combination of these drugs with long-acting bronchodilators like salmeterol and formoterol are used as preventers to stop asthma attacks from starting and thus protect lung function.,Short courses of corticosteroid and other drugs (oral or injectable) may be required during acute attacks and are to be used after medical advice only.,An asthma patient should learn from the care-provider the correct method of using the inhalation devices (metered-dose inhalers, dry-powder inhalers, spacers, etc) used for the medication and always carry the quick-reliever medication with him/her."
Airbag Eye Injury,"Airbag Eye Injury varying from minor abrasions to traumatic hyphaema and secondary glaucoma may result from automobile airbags. Airbags reduce the risk of injury and death from motor vehicle accident, however, injuries attributed to airbag use have been reported. There may be damage to virtually every structure of the eye and adnexa. Most injuries are self- limited and do not significantly affect vision, some result in severe visual loss. Damage to anterior structures of eye is commoner than injury to posterior segment. Posterior segment trauma is generally more visually devastating because of the involvement of optic nerve or retina.",Symptoms of automobile airbag trauma varies from the structure of eye and adnexa affected. Eye injuries may lead to,A motor vehicle crash may produce four collisions,Diagnosis depends upon the history of motor vehicle accident and clinical findings attributable to the eye injury sustained due to airbag.,Management depends upon the type and severity of injury caused by airbag.
Anthrax,Anthrax,"Anthrax infection occurs in three forms: cutaneous, inhalation, and gastrointestinal, depending on the mode of transmission. Cutaneous anthrax accounts for most of the cases in endemic situation.","Anthrax is caused by gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria known as Bacillus anthracis, an encapulated and spore-forming bacillus.","Laboratory confirmation is made by the demonstration of B. anthracis from the blood, skin lesions or respiratory secretions by direct polychrome methylene blue stained smears, although it is rapid and results are available in 2-3 hours, it is not specific.",Anthrax responds well to antibiotic treatment. Antibiotics must be prescribed and taken with medical advice. Nobody should attempt to use antibiotics or any other drugs to treat or protect themselves without first getting medical advice.
Amoebiasis,Amoebiasis,"The clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic infection, diarrhoea and dysentery to fulminant colitis and peritonitis as well as extra-intestinal amoebiasis.","Amoebiasis is caused by parasite Entamoeba histolytica. Several protozoan species in the genus Entamoeba colonize humans, but not all of them are associated with disease.  It exists in two forms- Vegetative (trophozoite) and cystic forms (cyst). Trophozoites multiply and encyst in the colon. The cysts are excreted in stool and are infective to humans. Cysts remain viable and infective for several days in faeces, water, sewage and soil in the presence of moisture and low temperature.","Entamoeba histolytica must be differentiated from other intestinal protozoa. Microscopic identification of cysts and trophozoites in the stool is the common method for diagnosing E. histolytica. Differentiation is based on morphologic characteristics of the cysts and trophozoites.,In addition, E. histolytica trophozoites can also be identified in aspirates or biopsy samples obtained during colonoscopy or surgery.","For symptomatic intestinal infection and extra intestinal disease, treatment with antiamoebic drugs should be taken with consultation of a physician. Asymptomatic patients infected with E. histolytica should also be treated with antiamoebic drugs, because they can infect others and because 4%–10% develop disease within a year if left untreated."
Atherosclerosis,Atherosclerosis is a disease in which plaque builds up inside   arteries. Arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood to   heart and other parts of your body.,"Atherosclerosis usually doesn't cause signs and symptoms until it severely narrows or totally blocks an artery. Many people don't know they have the disease until they have a medical emergency, such as   heart attack or stroke.","The exact cause of atherosclerosis isn't known. However, studies show that atherosclerosis is a slow, complex disease that may start in childhood. It develops faster as you age.",Physical Exam,"Management for atherosclerosis may include heart-healthy lifestyle changes, medicines, and medical procedures or surgery. The goals of treatment include:"
Adult Inclusion Conjunctivitis,"Adult inclusion conjunctivitis or Paratrachoma results due to infection by obligate intracellular bacterium, Chlamydia trachomatis (serotypes D to K), which causes chronic follicular conjunctivitis (follicular conjunctivitis lasting for more than 16- 28 days). These organisms infect the epithelium of mucoid surfaces and were once identified as the trachoma-inclusion conjunctivitis agents (TRIC agents). These organisms can also infect a neonate during birth and may lead to neonatal conjunctivitis.",Adult inclusion conjunctivitis presents as a unilateral (less commonly bilateral) affliction of eye.,"Chlamydia trachomatis causes trachoma (serotypes A, B, Ba and C) and also genital infections (serotypes D to K) and disease Lymphogranuloma venereum (serotypes L1 to L3).",Diagnosis of adult inclusion conjunctivitis depends upon clinical presentation and laboratory diagnosis.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Atopic Keratoconjunctivitis,"Atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) is a relatively uncommon, but potentially blinding ocular (eye) disease, which typically affects young people with atopic dermatitis.  AKC is a severe chronic inflammatory disease of the conjunctiva which may have dramatic consequences for visual function.","Unlike SAC, symptoms of AKC are usually present year-round, though a significant number of patients may have seasonal exacerbations.",Atopic keratoconjunctivitis is a chronic allergic conjunctivitis and may be due to:,Diagnosis of AKC is based upon typical clinical features.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Avian Influenza In Humans,"Avian influenza (AI) is an infectious viral disease of birds, commonly known as bird flu. Wild water fowl such as ducks and geese are mostly affected by AI, but often show no apparent signs of illness. Poultry birds are also susceptible to AI infection that can cause large outbreaks and epidemics in poultry.",Signs and symptoms of Avian influenza A virus infections in humans-,Disease is caused by avian influenza virus belongs to the Influenza A genus of the orthomyxoviridae family.,Diagnosis of Avian influenza is suspected in all persons presenting with acute febrile respiratory illness in those countries or territories where avian influenza A viruses have been identified in animal populations.,Hospital care is recommended in initial stages of the disease (such as Human infection with an A(H5N1) to monitor clinical status. After discharge from hospital appropriate instructions for household members on personal hygiene and infection control measures should be provided.
Astigmatism,"Astigmatism is a type of refractive error wherein the refraction varies in different meridian. As a result, the light rays entering the eye cannot converge to a point focus but form focal lines.",Symptoms vary according to the degree and type of regular astigmatism and may include,"Astigmatism may be natural, traumatic following a wound or surgically induced as is seen following cataract surgery. Tight sutures after surgery further accentuate astigmatism.",Diagnosis of astigmatism depends upon the symptoms and clinical features.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Aphakia,Aphakia is a condition in which crystalline lens of the eye is not present in its normal position of pupillary area. Either there is no crystalline lens inside the eye or the lens is subluxated or luxated. This induces a refractive state which is not a refractive error in true sense. An emmetropic (normal refraction) eye or one having low grade ametropia (refractive error) becomes extremely hypermetropic after cataract surgery. A previously emmetropic eye requires a correction of about 10 to 11 dioptres (D) in spectacle when worn in the usual position.,Aphakia causes symptoms such as,Causes of aphakia are,Diagnosis depends upon the symptoms and signs of aphakia.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Anisometropia,"Anisometropia is an optical state with unequal refraction of the two eyes. The amount of spherical refractive error (myopia or hypermetropia) is usually about the same for both the eyes in most of the people. Generally, anisometropia is considered to exist if the refraction differs by 1.0 dioptres (D) or more for the two eyes. The measuring unit for refractive error is dioptre (D), which is defined as the reciprocal of the focal length in meters. Anisometropia is the most insidious refractive condition because it is often asymptomatic. The term antimetropia is used when one eye is myopic and the other is hypermetropic.",Anisometropia occurs because of uncorrected unequal refractive error between fellow eyes. Uncorrected anisometropia produces,Anisometropia may be congenital or acquired.,Diagnosis depends upon retinoscopic examination in patients with defective visual acuity.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Aniseikonia,"Aniseikonia is defined as a difference in the shape and/or size of images presented to the visual cortex by two eyes. The brain is unable to fuse two images, resulting in an extra ghost image or diplopia. Aniseikonia is often produced due to significant amount of anisometropia, especially when it is corrected by spectacles instead of contact lenses.  It is difficult to detect aniseikonia based on history and clinical examination. Aniseikonia precludes fusion of images when the degree is large. Despite this, it is rare that a patient volunteer a difference in image size and/or shape between the two eyes. Aniseikonia is usually considered clinically significant when the image size difference is greater than 4 percent, but many patients experience distortions in spatial perception and/or uncomfortable binocular vision with differences as small as 2 percent.","Tolerance for the disease varies amongst individual patient. Some patients apparently are able to tolerate rather large aniseikonia and others suffer severe symptoms with even smaller degree. It is when difference in size of the image or meridional distortions approaches tolerance levels that the symptoms manifest. Meridional distortions are poorly tolerated, especially when they are oblique.","Aniseikonia may occur naturally or is produced secondary to correction of refractive error. Up to 7% of aniseikonia between two eyes is usually tolerated well, and it corresponds to about 3 dioptres (D) of anisometropia. The measuring unit for refractive error is dioptre (D), which is defined as the reciprocal of the focal length in meters.",Diagnosis depends upon clinical symptoms and retinoscopic examination in patients with defective visual acuity.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Asbestos-Related Diseases,Asbestos-related diseases,"Repeated or prolonged inhalation of asbestos fibers may cause asbestosis (fibrosis of the lungs), pleural plaques, thickening and pleural effusion. Individuals who have been exposed (or suspect they have been exposed) to asbestos fibers on the job, through the environment, or at home via a family contact should consult their doctor whether or not they experience any symptoms. The symptoms of asbestos-related diseases may be apparent after many decades, such as;","There are six types of asbestos minerals (chrysotile, amosite, crocidolite, tremolite, anthophyllite and actinolite). All commercial forms of asbestos are carcinogenic.",A thorough physical examination is recommended with the following tests-,No specific therapy is recommended for asbestos related diseases.
Amblyopia,"Amblyopia is often defined as a difference in visual acuity of two lines or more on Snellen or equivalent chart in a child with, otherwise, healthy eyes. Amblyopia may be present any time visual acuity is reduced, and the reduction of acuity cannot be explained by findings on clinical examination, even if the difference is even one line only.","The main symptom of amblyopia is decreased foveal visual acuity. Commonly used diagnostic criteria, is the loss of visual acuity of two or more lines on the Snellen vision chart.","A distinction must be made between potentially reversible functional amblyopia and irreversible organic amblyopia. Organic amblyopia is a term used to describe visual impairment due to obvious or non obvious ocular pathology, commonly affecting retina or optic nerve. Examples of organic amblyopia are optic nerve hypoplasia, optic atrophy and foveal hypoplasia. Functional amblyopia may occur along with organic amblyopia. Functional amblyopia normally occurs in an eye that is anatomically normal.",Diagnosis of amblyopia is based mainly on measurement of visual acuity.,"Early management of amblyopia is critical for best visual acuity results. The basic strategy for treating amblyopia is to first provide a clear retinal image, and then correct ocular dominance if ocular dominance is present, as early as possible during the period of visual plasticity (birth to eight years of life)."
Ankyloblepharon,"Ankyloblepharon is defined as adhesion of the edges of upper eyelid with the lower eyelid. The eyelids maintain their integrity and identity. The condition is usually congenital but may be acquired. In congenital ankyloblepharon, the fused eyelids fail to separate completely during development of embryo. Congenital ankyloblepharon is caused by developmental arrest leading to aberration in growth at either medial or lateral canthus. It may occur as a sporadic finding or in association with chromosomal/syndromic conditions.",Patients may have symptoms such as,Congenital ankyloblepharon:,Diagnosis of ankyloblepharon is based on clinical features.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,"Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is a common problem among (non-pregnant) women in the reproductive age. Formerly, it was known as dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB). AUB is responsible for significant health problem and social embarrassment and it is one of the common reasons women seek health care. It has a significant impact on the quality of life for the women. Women with abnormal bleeding have a lower quality of life than the general female population.",Abnormal uterine bleeding may present as any of the following symptoms-,"International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) introduced PLAM-COEIN system of classification in 2011 to define the causes of abnormal uterine bleeding. There are 9 main categories of etiology of AUB, which are arranged according to the acronym PALM-COEIN.","Thorough history and physical examination are the preliminary components for diagnosing the cause of AUB, and also help to suggest investigations for final diagnosis and to guide options for management. Women with AUB may have multiple factors that may contribute in genesis of AUB or sometimes a pathology (such as subserosal leiomyoma) is present but not responsible for the AUB. In women of child bearing age, pregnancy and its related complications should be excluded.",The ultimate goal of any form of treatment is to reduce menstrual flow in order to improve quality of life. The two main objectives of managing acute AUB are:
Acquired Capillary Haemangioma Of Eyelid,"Acquired Capillary Haemangioma of Eyelid (Cherry haemangioma, senile haemangioma) is a common skin lesion in middle aged and older patients. Virtually, it occurs in all adults at one time or the other. The lesions may be small and may be ignored. The number of haemangiomas varies from one to two in children to even up to hundred in some elderly patients. Most commonly it affects chest or extremities, but can occasionally affect eyelids and periocular area. It varies in size from being barely visible to a dome shaped bright red swellings about 5 mm in diameter.",Solitary acquired haemangioma of the eyelid appear as distinct red to red-blue papule ranging in size from about 0.5 mm to 5 mm in size.,The acquired capillary haemangioma looks similar to mature type of congenital capillary haemangioma.,"Clinically, solitary acquired capillary haemangioma of eyelid may present as a red to red-blue papule which may range from 0.5 to 5 mm in size. Smaller lesions are red in colour and the larger ones give a bluish appearance. These may become pedunculated with cherry-like surface irregularity, hence the name cherry haemangioma. It generally moves with the skin. Localised haemangiomas are usually very compressible. It may bleed following trauma.","Most acquired capillary haemangiomas are just observed over time, since they are generally small and have no malignant potential."
Anaemia During Pregnancy (Maternal Anemia),"Anaemia during pregnancy is one of the important factors associated with a number of maternal and foetal complications. It decreases the woman’s reserve to tolerate bleeding either during or after child birth and makes prone to infections. Anaemia during pregnancy also has been associated with increased risk of intra uterine growth restriction, premature delivery, low birth weight (LBW) and maternal and child mortality.","Early symptoms of anemia are usually nonspecific such as fatigue, weakness, light-headedness, mild dyspnea during exertion.","The common causes of anemia during pregnancy are nutritional disorders and infections. Among nutritional disorders iron deficiency is the most common cause of anaemia globally. Other conditions such as folate, vitamin B12 and vitamin A deficiency, chronic inflammation, parasitic infections, and inherited disorders can all cause anemia.","Diagnosis of anemia during pregnancy is done by the symptoms, clinical signs and investigations.","As the need for iron increases during pregnancy, prophylactic oral iron therapy is given to all pregnant women with normal laboratory values. All pregnant women at 14-16th week (second trimester) should be given one tablet of Albendazole 400mg – single dose. In the anemic mother management and form of therapeutic iron supplementation depend on the duration of pregnancy and severity of anemia."
Antepartum Hemorrhage (Bleeding In Late Pregnancy),"Antepartum haemorrhage (APH) is defined as bleeding from or in to the genital tract, occurring from 24+0 weeks of pregnancy and prior to the birth of the baby. APH complicates 3–5% of pregnancies; and is a leading cause of perinatal and maternal mortality worldwide.",Symptoms of antepartum haemorrhage (APH) consist of vaginal bleeding in late pregnancy and before delivery. Along with vaginal bleeding other symptoms may be-,"The causes of APH include: placenta praevia, placental abruption and local causes (such as bleeding from the vulva, vagina or cervix). Abruption is more likely to be related to conditions occurring during pregnancy and placenta praevia is more likely to be related to conditions existing prior to pregnancy.",Diagnosis of antepartum hemorrhage is first based on clinical suspicion. Initially clinical assessment of women presenting with APH is done by medical person to establish urgency of intervention required to manage maternal or fetal compromise.,"Management of APH depends on various factors. These are-  amount and cause of APH, condition of mother and foetus, duration of pregnancy and presence of associated complication. Each pregnant woman with APH is assessed on an individual basis and according to that clinical judgment is applied."
Acute Encephalitis Syndrome,"Acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) is a serious public health problem in India. It is characterized as acute-onset of fever and a change in mental status (mental confusion, disorientation, delirium, or coma) and/or new-onset of seizures in a person of any age at any time of the year. The disease most commonly affects children and young adults and can lead to considerable morbidity and mortality.",Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) is a general description of the clinical presentation of a disease characterized by high fever altered consciousness mostly in children below 15 years of age.,"Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) has a very complex etiology. Causative agents of AES include a wide variety of viruses, bacteria, protozoa, fungi, and non- infectious agents. While Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a leading cause of acute encephalitis syndrome in India (ranging from 5-35%), the etiology in a large number of cases however remains unidentified. In India during 2018, 15% of cases of AES were found positive for infection due to JEV.","The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme in India has set up country wide surveillance for AES through sentinel sites with a focus on detecting Japanese encephalitis (JEV). In the sentinel surveillance network, AES/JE is diagnosed by lgM Capture ELISA, and virus isolation is done in National Reference Laboratory.",Management of AES is essentially symptomatic. First line of management should be started at grass root level. To reduce severe morbidity and mortality it is important to identify early warning signs and refer patient to higher health facility.
Amaurosis Fugax,"Amaurosis Fugax or transient monocular blindness (TMB) refers to transient brief blindness, blurring, fogging, or dimming of vision, varying in duration from few seconds to minutes or even hours in some cases. The duration of visual impairment is brief usually less than fifteen minutes and rarely exceeding thirty minutes. The term Amaurosis fugax has been used not only for monocular condition, but also for the transient loss of vision in both eyes (less common). Most of the patients are affected for about one to five minutes only. Generally, recovery is in the same pattern as the visual loss, although usually more gradual. Amaurosis is also known as blackout.",Symptoms vary according to the type of Amaurosis depending upon visual loss occurrence:,The causes of Amaurosis fugax are divided into five groups,Diagnosis depends upon clinical history and examination.,Management
Abducens Nerve Palsy,"Abducens (or Abducent) nerve Palsy or Cranial nerve six palsy (CN VI) is a common neuro-ophthalmic disorder. Since CN VI has a long intracranial course, it may be affected by multiple aetiologies. It may be unilateral or bilateral condition.",Symptoms include,The causes of Abducens nerve palsy are varied.,Patients with CN VI paresis present with esotropia (inward deviation) of the affected eye. Outward movement beyond primary position or midline is lost or reduced. Patients presenting with partial or mild palsy adopt posture with head turn toward the affected side to minimise diplopia by keeping the affected eye adducted (inward movement). Severe cases may shut the eye or cover it to avoid diplopia.,"Like other cranial nerve palsies, root cause of palsy should be treated."
Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the most common childhood behavioural disorder. It is a chronic disorder which may cause impairment into adolescence and adulthood.,"Most children with ADHD are referred for impairment in family, academic, and/or peer relationship functioning. Symptoms of over-activity, inattention, and impulsivity drive this impairment even later.",The aetiology of ADHD is yet to be determined.,Systemic features,Behavioural and pharmacologic interventions are used in the management of ADHD.
Blindness,"Visual impairment is when a person has sight loss that cannot be fully corrected using glasses or contact lenses.,Blindness as defined by national programme for control of blindness (NPCB) under following headings:,Inability of a person to count fingers from a distance of 6 meters or 20 feet (technical definition),Vision 6/60 or less with the best possible spectacle correction,Diminution of field vision to 20 feet or less in better eye,There are two main categories of visual impairment:,Being partially sighted or sight impaired – where the level of sight loss is moderate,Severe sight impairment (blindness) – where the level of sight loss is so severe that activities that rely on eyesight become impossible.,Types of Blindness:,Economic blindness: Inability of a person to count fingers from a distance of 6 meters or 20 feet technical Definition,Social blindness: Vision 3/60 or diminution of field of vision to 10°,Manifest blindness: Vision 1/60 to just perception of light,Absolute blindness: No perception of light,Curable blindness: That stage of blindness where the damage is reversible by prompt management e.g. cataract,Preventable blindness: The loss of blindness that could have been completely prevented by institution of effective preventive or prophylactic measures e.g. xerophthalmia, trachoma and glaucoma,Avoidable blindness: The sum total of preventable or curable blindness is often referred to as avoidable blindness.,National Programme for Control of Blindness,Pre-operative, Operative and Post-operative precautions for Eye Surgery",,"Blindness can be caused due to numerous conditions, the leading causes are:,The leading causes of chronic blindness include cataract, refractive errors, glaucoma, corneal opacities, age-related macular degeneration, trachoma, childhood blindness and diabetic retinopathy.,Cataract is the opacification of the lens in the eye and in advanced cases a whitish reflex can be seen in the eye. The most important symptom is painless progressive blurring of vision.,Refractive errors occur when the rays of light entering the eye do not focus onto the retina, the part of the eye on which the image forms. This is a very important cause of poor vision in children.,Glaucoma occurs when the pressure of the eye is increased and that causes progressive loss of sight. It is very important to identify and treat glaucoma as the vision lost is irreversible.,In corneal opacities the clear part of the eye in the front through which the light enters the eye becomes opaque and the patient cannot see.,The type of partial vision loss may differ, depending on the cause:,With cataracts, vision may be cloudy or fuzzy, and bright light may cause glare.,With diabetes, vision may be blurred, there may be shadows or missing areas of vision and difficulty seeing at night.,With glaucoma, there may be tunnel vision and missing areas of vision.,With macular degeneration, the peripheral (side) vision is normal but the central vision is slowly lost.","There are two main areas that are looked at when someone's vision is measured:,Visual acuity – It is central vision and is used to look at objects in detail, such as reading a book or watching television.,Visual field – It is the ability to see around the edge of vision while looking straight ahead.,Visual field testing,During visual field testing one will be instructed to look straight ahead at a device while lights are flashed on and off in peripheral vision. Person will be asked to press a button every time you see a light. This shows any gaps in his field of vision.,Test for visual acuity,A Snellen chart is used to measure visual acuity. It involves reading letters off a chart on which the letters become progressively smaller. This chart is used during a routine eye test. After the test, a score made up of two numbers is given. The first number represents how far away from the chart were able to successfully read the letters on the chart. The second number represents how far away a person with healthy vision should be able to read the chart.,So if you were given a visual acuity score of 6/60, it means you can only read 6 meters away what a person with healthy eyesight can read 60 meters away. The normal eyesight is 6/6.,Partial sight impairment,Partial sight, or sight impairment, is usually defined as:,Having very poor visual acuity (3/60 to 6/60) but having a full field of vision,Having a combination of moderate visual acuity (up to 6/24) and a reduced field of vision or having blurriness or cloudiness in your central vision,Having relatively good visual acuity (up to 6/18) but a lot of your field of vision is missing,Severe sight impairment (blindness),The legal definition of severe sight impairment (blindness) is when 'a person is so blind that they cannot do any work for which eyesight is essential'.,This usually falls into one of three categories:,Having extremely poor visual acuity (less than 3/60) but having a full field of vision,Having poor visual acuity (between 3/60 and 6/60) and a severe reduction in your field of vision,Having average visual acuity (6/60 or better) and an extremely reduced field of vision","The treatment of blindness depends on the cause of blindness.,Blindness due to nutritional defificiency: It can be addressed by dietary changes.,Visual impairment due to refractive error: It can be addressed by doing a refraction and providing appropriate spectacles.,Inflammatory and infectious causes of blindness can be treated with medication in the form of drops or pills.,Most of people are blind due to cataract: In these patients, cataract surgery would, in most cases, restore their sight. Usually an intraocular lens (IOL) is implanted in the eye after removal of the opaque natural lens."
Breast Cancer / Carcinoma,"Cancer that forms in tissues of the breast is usually the ducts (tubes that carry milk to the nipple) and lobules (glands that make milk). It occurs in both men and women, although male breast cancer is rare. Breast cancer is the top cancer in women both in the developed and the developing world.,There are various forms of cancers like:,Ductal Carcinomas: Cancer originating from ducts.,Lobular carcinomas: Cancer originating from lobules.","The most noticeable symptoms are lump that feels different from the rest of the breast tissue. Other than a lump, there may include:",The exact reason for the breast cancer is not known but risks factors associated with the disease are:,Contact your physician: If there is any kind of symptoms like lump or change in shape or color of breast. Than you should contact your physician.,The main treatments required for breast cancer are:
Bronchitis,Bronchitis is an inflammation of the mucous membranes of the bronchi (the larger and medium-sized airways that carry airflow from the trachea into the more distal parts of the lung parenchyma). Bronchitis can be divided into:,"The main symptom of bronchitis is persistent cough with thick yellow gray mucous, though it may not always be present. Other symptoms of bronchitis may include:","The bronchitis can be caused by either a virus or bacteria, though viral bronchitis is much more common. In most cases, bronchitis is caused by the same viruses that cause the common cold or influenza (flu).","When symptoms like cough persist for more than 2 weeks, one should need to visit the doctor.",For Acute Bronchitis:
Brucellosis,Brucellosis,"Initial symptoms include; fever, weakness, malaise, anorexia, headache, pain in muscles and joint and/or back, fatigue.","Brucellosis is caused by different species of bacteria Brucella such as Brucella abortus,Brucella melitensis,  Brucella suis, Brucella canis. They are shed in large numbers in the urine, milk and placental fluid of infected animals.",The clinical picture is not specific therefore diagnosis needs to be supported by laboratory tests.,Antibiotics are used to treat the infection and prevent the recurrence of disease. Longer courses of therapy may be needed if there are complications.
Bedsores,"Bedsores are also called pressure sores or pressure ulcers . Bedsores are injuries to skin and underlying tissues resulting from prolonged pressure on the skin. Bedsores generally develop on skin that covers bony areas of the body, such as heels, ankles, hips or buttocks.",Symptoms of a bedsores are:,"Pressure on the skin leads to  reduced blood flow to the area. Without enough blood skin dies, leading to formation of ulcer.","If one is bedridden or wheelchair, observe for signs of bedsores. The severity of skin breakdown may be categorized as follows:","The treatment of bedsores depends on the severity (i.e. the stage) of the wound. Depending on the severity, a variety of approaches may be used to promote healing. They include synthetic dressings, saline dressings, acetic acid compresses, and various antibiotic dressings (bedsores are particularly prone to infection)."
Back Pain,,Upper or middle back pain,"Bending for long periods,lifting, carrying, pushing or pulling incorrectly,Twisting,Over-stretching,Driving in a curved position or driving for long periods without taking a break,Overuse of the muscles, usually due to sport or repetitive movements","Most cases of back pain do not require medical attention and can be treated with painkillers and self-care. The physical examination will usually assess your capacity to sit, stand, walk and lift your legs, as well as testing the range of movement in your back.",Pain relievers: Paracetamol and NSAIDs (Non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs) such as ibuprofen etc are effective pain killers during back pain.
Bell'S Palsy,Bell's palsy is a form of facial paralysis resulting from a dysfunction of the cranial nerve VII (the facial nerve) causing temporary weakness of the muscles on one side of the face. Symptoms vary from person to person. It is of following types:,"Irritation of the affected eye, such as dryness or increased tear production,Pain underneath the ear on the affected side of the face,Drooling from the mouth on the affected side of the face,Dryness of the mouth,Difficulty in eating or drinking,Impaired speech,Weakness or paralysis in one side of the face, which may make it difficult to close the eyelid and cause the side of the mouth to droop,An altered or reduced sense of taste,Increased sensitivity to sound in the affected ear,Pain around the jaw,Headache,Dizziness",Virus:,There is no specific test to diagnose Bell’s palsy. Symptoms associated with the bell's palsy help physician to determine the disease.,Pain relievers: Paracetamol and NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs) such as ibuprofen etc. are effective pain killers.
Brain Tumour,"Brain tumour is an abnormal or uncontrolled growth of cells found in the brain. In a healthy human body, normal cells grow old or die and new cells take their place. Sometimes, this process goes wrong. Some unnecessary new cells are produced when the body doesn't need them, and old or damaged cells don't die as they should. The formation of these extra cells often forms a mass of tissue called a growth or tumour. There are two main types of tumours which are called benign tumours (harmless growth) and malignant (cancerous tumours).,Brain tumour is a deadly disease. However, it can be treated by various methods but majority of patients die within 9-12 months and less than 3% survive more than 3 years.,Cancerous tumours can be divided into primary brain tumours that start within the brain, and secondary brain tumours that originate from somewhere else, but spread throughout the body, known as brain metastasis tumours.,There are many types of primary brain tumours. They are named according to the type of cells or the part of the brain in which they are found or begin. For example, if the brain tumour begins in glial cells it is called glioma. Similarly there are other types depending upon the part of brain in which the tumour originates.","The most common symptoms of brain tumour  are:,Headache  (usually worse in the morning),Nausea and vomiting,Changes in speech, vision, or hearing,Problems in balancing or walking,Changes in mood, personality, or ability to concentrate,Problems with memory,Muscle jerking or twitching (seizures or convulsions),Numbness or tingling in the arms or legs,Abnormal fatigue and weariness,Symptoms of tumour are associated with the position they present.,Each part of our brain control  particular function , so a tumour can affect a specific area of the brain, thereby affecting its normal function  . Some of the symptoms, according to their position, are as follows:,Brain stem:,Lack of co-ordination when walking,Double vision,Difficulty in swallowing and speaking,Facial weakness – one-sided smile,Eyelid weakness -  Difficulty in closing eye,Cerebellum:,Flickering, involuntary movement of the eyes,Vomiting and stiffness of the neck,Uncoordinated walking and speech,Temporal lobe:,Speech difficulties and memory problems.,Strange sensations – fear, blackouts, strange smells,Occipital lobe:,Gradual loss of vision on one side,Parietal lobe:,Problems with reading, writing or simple calculations,Difficulty in navigating one's way around,Numbness or weakness in one side of the body,Difficulty in understanding words or speaking,Frontal lobe:,Unsteadiness and weakness on one side of body,Changes in personality,Loss of smell","There is no specific cause of brain tumour. Mutation of certain genes is thought to be the main cause of some types of tumour. The role of radiation caused by gadgets like mobile phones in causing various types of cancers including brain tumour is widely debated. However, this fact has not yet been proven. Research into this field is ongoing. Brain tumours, like other tumours, are not infectious and can't be passed on to other people.","Based on   history, symptoms, physical and neurological examination, techniques like MRI, CT scan, angiogram or spinal tap may assist in diagnosis.,Neurologic exam: It includes testing of vision, hearing, alertness, muscle strength, coordination, and reflexes. Eyes  are looked for swelling, caused by a tumour pressing on the nerve that connects the eye and the brain.,Angiogram: It is an imaging technique in which dye is injected into the bloodstream. If a tumour is present, the image may show the tumour or blood vessels that are feeding into the tumour.,Spinal tap: For diagnosis, sample of cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid that fills the spaces in and around the brain and spinal cord) is usually collected by a technique called lumbar puncture. For this process, a long, thin needle is used to remove fluid and it takes about 30 minutes.,MRI and CT scan are very useful imaging techniques in the diagnosis of brain tumour.","The treatment of brain tumour depends upon the type, grade, and position of tumour and general health of patient."
Benign Essential Blepharospasm,"Benign essential blepharospasm (BEB) is an idiopathic disorder of progressive involuntary spasms of orbicularis oculi and upper facial muscles leading to closure of eyelids. BEB is a bilateral condition and a form of focal dystonia (repetitive involuntary sustained muscle contraction) characterised by episodic contraction of protractor (drawing a part forward) muscles (orbicularis oculi, procerus and corrugator superciliaris) and is not associated with another disease. Severe blepharospasm may temporarily make patient functionally blind. Blepharospasm may be precipitated by factors such as reading, bright light, driving or stress and alleviated by talking, relaxation or walking.",Benign essential blepharospasm may have following symptoms:-,Exact cause of benign essential blepharospasm is not known.,Diagnosis of BEB is made clinically (based on history and physical examination) and it is a diagnosis of exclusion by ruling out the presence of associated conditions.,Management should be under medical supervision.
Blepharitis,"Blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelid margins. It is a common disorder affecting external eye, the cause for which is unclear, although seborrhoea and staphylococcal infection play important roles.","The symptoms of various types of blepharitis are similar, although there is frequently little correlation between their severity and the extent of clinical involvement. Many of the symptoms are secondary to tear film abnormality.","Exact aetiology of blepharitis is complex and not fully understood, though infection and inflammation contribute to the disease.",Diagnosis depends upon the clinical presentation and examination of patient by an eye specialist.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Band Shaped Keratopathy,"Band Shaped Keratopathy (Calcific band keratopathy, or band keratopathy) is a non-specific corneal condition characterised by chronic deposition of calcium salts (principally hydroxyapatite) within the basement membrane, Bowman’s layer and anterior stromal lamellae of the corneal epithelium (leaving remainder of the cornea clear). Initially, corneal degenerative changes begin near the limbus, either on nasal, temporal or both sides together in exposed palpebral fissure at 3 to 9 o’clock position. Calcific band is concentric with the limbus but is separated from it by a clear zone (representing a lucid interval) due to lack of Bowman’s layer at the periphery, or due to buffering action at the limbus. Keratopathy appears as a superficial greyish-white corneal opacity having frosted or ground glass appearance. The opacity is covered by clear epithelium with lacunae of uninvolved tissue. There are numerous holes where corneal nerves penetrate the Bowman’s layer. The disease progresses toward the corneal center and thickens as well in its anterior and posterior dimensions, resulting in more opaque, whitish surface with increased nodularity. Calcium deposits thicken and may cause breakdown of the overlying epithelium, resulting in the appearance of spontaneous and recurrent corneal epithelial erosions.",Patients with band shaped keratopathy are asymptomatic in the early stages of the disease.,"Numerous mechanisms, whether systemic or local to the eye, by which the balance of the calcium phosphate solubility product are tilted toward abnormal tissue calcification resulting nonspecific finding of band keratopathy. As such, there are many diseases associated with this condition. Though we tend to think first of conditions such as uveitis and systemic hypercalcaemia, in a recent series the most commonly associated causes of calcific band keratopathy were chronic corneal oedema, phthisis bulbi, and even idiopathic cases.",Diagnosis of band shaped keratopathy depends upon clinical presentation.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Burns,"Burns are a serious public health problem. A burn is defined as an injury to the skin or other organic tissue primarily caused by heat or due to radiation, radioactivity, electricity, friction or contact with chemicals.",Symptoms of burn depend on the depth of the burn. Burns can be divided into three types.,Common causes of burns may be classified as thermal or inhalational.,A detailed history and physical examination are the initial steps in diagnosis.,"A burn accident can happen at any place and at any time where medical personnel are usually not around. The first aid has to be provided by the bystanders, who become the “first responders”. Extent of damage can be minimized by providing quick and proper on the site management."
Blepharochalasis,"Blepharochalasis is a rare disorder that typically affects upper lids. It is characterised by intermittent oedema of the lids, with frequent recurrence. It produces eyelid tissue relaxation and latter atrophy. It may be unilateral in some cases. In addition to recurrent attacks of oedema, it is associated with ‘cigarette-paper’ skin and subcutaneous telangiectasia.",Patient may present with symptoms like,Blepharophimosis may be a form of chronic angioedema with localised vascular dilatation and extravasation of proteinaceous fluid. Orbital fat may have increased vascularity and dilated capillaries.,Diagnosis depends upon history of disease and clinical examination. There are no characteristic laboratory findings.,Nothing much can be done to ameliorate acute phase of blepharochalasis. Avoidance of triggering factors may diminish the frequency of attacks.
Bad Breath (Halitosis),Bad breath or Halitosis (oral malodour) is an unpleasant odour of the mouth. It is a common complaint for both genders and for all age groups. Nearly more than 50% of the general population in developed countries have halitosis.,,Halitosis has numerous causes and origins.,"Diagnosis of bad breath or halitosis, and assessment of its severity is very important to find out if it is genuine halitosis or pseudo-halitosis or halitophobia.",
Bleeding Gums,"Bleeding from gums may occur while brushing or sometimes it occurs on its own (spontaneously). If you often see a pink tinge in the sink after brushing teeth, you have bleeding gums. It may be a sign of inflammation of gums. Inflamed gums appear red and swollen while healthy gums are light pink in colour.",,There are many possible causes of bleeding from gums such as:,"If your gums bleed regularly, go for a dental checkup to get examined for oral hygiene status. Examination by dentist should be done to rule out the issues such as malnutrition, puberty and pregnancy.","If you don’t brush and floss properly and regularly, then do so."
Bruxism (Teeth Grinding),"Habitual grinding or clenching of teeth, either during sleep or as an unconscious habit during waking hours, is known as Bruxism and commonly called as “Teeth Grinding”.",,CAUSES:,DIAGNOSIS:,
Cancer,"Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell division that leads to abnormal tissue growth. Many a times, people often use the terms cancer and tumor synonymously. But all tumours are not cancerous.","Symptoms of cancer, are usually caused by the effect of cancer on the part of body where it is growing. Although symptoms of cancer may appear in the form of general debility including weight loss or tiredness, yet it is generally advised that if anyone is experiencing unusual symptoms for more than a few weeks than he/she should seek medical attention.",Various causes of cancer are:,Cancers can generally be recognized by appearance of signs and symptoms through screening.,"Remedial treatment: Remedial treatment refers to treatment which seeks to make the patient feel better and may or may not be combined with an attempt to attack the cancer. Treatment includes action to reduce the physical, emotional, spiritual, and psycho-social agony experienced by people with cancer."
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome,"Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a relatively common condition that causes pain, numbness and a tingling sensation in the hand and fingers. The sensations develop gradually and then worsens during the night. They tend to affect the thumb, index finger, middle finger and half of the ring finger. It is generally caused by pressure on the median nerve in wrist.",The three main symptoms are:,The symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) are caused by compression or pressure of the median nerve at the wrist.,"Physical tests: Flexing the wrist for a minute or holding it elevated above the head for a minute are other commonly performed simple tests for CTS, and should stimulate the same pain, numbness or tingling in hand if you have the condition.","Wrist Splints: A wrist splint is generally worn at night to support the wrist and keep it in the same position. The splint prevents the wrist from bending, which can place pressure on the median nerve and aggravate symptoms."
Chickenpox,"Chickenpox is a viral infection and is highly contagious. It is caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Chickenpox primarily occurs in children under 10 years of age but can affect the adults as well. The disease can be severe in adults.  It causes different of skin eruption described as ‘pleomorphic rash’, besides itching, tiredness and fever.",It includes:,Chickenpox spreads from infected person to non-infected person (contagious disease). The virus spreads through coughing or sneezing of infected person. It can also be spread by touching the virus particles that come from chickenpox blisters.,"Chickenpox can be diagnosed with classical symptoms. However, Microscopic examination of the skin lesion can be done for laboratory confirmation of the disease.",Calamine lotion is used in in relieving the itching during checkenpox. Fingernails should be trimmed short so as to prevent skin infections caused by scratching blisters.
Chikungunya Fever,"Chikungunya fever is a debilitating, but non-fatal, viral illness. It is spread by the bite of infected female Aedes aegypti mosquito. Aedes mosquito breeds in clean water collections. The water containers, tanks, discarded material such as buckets, utensils, tyres, flower-pots etc. are the breeding sites for these mosquitoes. The peak biting times of the Aedes aegypti mosquito are early morning or late evening. Chikungunya fever is caused by a virus of genus alphavirus in the family of togaviridae.  It is diagnosed based on symptoms, physical findings (e.g. joint swelling), laboratory testing and the possibility of exposure to infected mosquitoes. There is no specific treatment for Chikungunya fever. The treatment is mainly supportive to ease the symptoms.","It is generally characterized by abrupt onset of fever, chills which is accompanied by joint pain. Other symptoms include:","Chikungunya virus is spread by the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on a person infected with Chikungunya virus. The incubation period (time from infection to illness) can be 2-12 days, but is usually 3-7 days. “Silent” Chikungunya virus infections (infections without illness) do occur, though rarely.",The clinical appearance of both chikungunya and dengue are similar. Therefore laboratory confirmation is important especially in areas where dengue is present. Enzyme-Linked Immuno-sorbent Assay (ELISA) may confirm the presence of IgM and IgG anti-Chikungunya antibodies.,There is no specific treatment for chikungunya. Only supportive treatment is given to ease the symptoms
Cholera,"Cholera is an intestinal infection which is caused when a person consumes contaminated food or water. It is generally caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It has a short incubation period, from one day to five days. After contamination, bacteria produces an enterotoxin that causes a copious, painless, watery diarrhea that can quickly lead to severe dehydration and death if treatment is not promptly given. Vomiting also occurs in most patients.","Cholera infection is often mild or without symptoms, but can sometimes be severe.","Cholera is a diarrheal illness caused by the bacteria Vibrio cholerae. This species is not common to humans, and its presence in the human digestive system is not part of the natural life cycle of the bacteria.","Laboratory tests include stool gram stain (gram negative rods) culture, dark field microscopy or stool PCR. One must begin treatment even before diagnostic work-up.",Have plenty of fluids:
Coronary Heart Disease,"Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the thinning or blockage of the coronary arteries, usually caused by atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis (sometimes called “hardening” or “clogging” of the arteries) is the buildup of cholesterol and fatty deposits (called plaques) on the inner walls of the arteries. These deposits can restrict blood flow to the heart muscle by clogging the artery. This result in reduced supply of blood to the heart, thus heart becomes starved of oxygen and the vital nutrients it requires to work properly. This can lead to chest pain called angina. If blood supply to a portion of the heart muscle is cut off entirely, or if the energy demands of the heart become much greater than its blood supply, a heart attack (injury to the heart muscle) may occur. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death for both men and women living in urban areas as compared to rural India.",The most common feature of CHD is chest pain (angina) and heart attack. Generally pain occurs when the heart is not getting enough blood or oxygen. The intensity of pain is varies from person to person.,Risk factors associated with the conditions are:,Tests may include:,"Medications like Aspirin , beta blockers, nitrates, calcium channel blockers, nikoran, trimetazadine, and ranolazine along with statins."
Cough,"The cough is a sudden and often repetitively occurring reflex which helps to clear the large breathing passages from secretions, irritants, foreign particles and microbes. The cough reflex consists of three phases:",,"Acute cough: It is caused due to respiratory tract infection caused by a virus. Conditions like influenza (flu), laryngitis and common cold which mostly occur in upper tract infections. Conditions like bronchitis and pneumonia in case of lower tract infections.",If the cough persists for more than one week. It is advised to visit doctor.,Cough can generally be treated by treating the symptoms associated with it.
Childhood Exotropia,"Childhood exotropia (outward deviation) is a horizontal exodeviation characterised by visual axis forming a divergent angle. It usually begins as exophoria. Exophoria is a condition in which eyes are straight without deviation when both eyes are open. However, eye under cover deviates on cover-uncover test or alternate cover test. It may progress to exotropia which may be latent (exophoria) or manifest (Exotropia). Fluctuation between phoria and tropia is common in exotropia.",Patient with Childhood exotropia may present with:-,Heredity appears to have role in exodeviation.,For diagnosis of childhood exotropia:-,Nonsurgical methods of correction are adopted in children having good control of deviation as well as in those where risks of overcorrection are undesirable.
Chalazion,Chalazion (Meibomian cyst),"Chalazion usually present as small, painless, firm roundish lesion over the tarsal plate area in the lid skin.",Chalazion occurs due to blockage of the orifice of meibomian gland duct. Blockage of ducts may be potentiated due to certain associated conditions such as :-,"A patient may have painless swelling present on the lids for days and weeks and may seek attention for cosmetic reason. There may be single or multiple swellings. Frequently, there is history of previous similar occurrences. A patient may present with diminution of vision especially with large centrally placed chalazion of upper lid pressing onto the cornea. It may lead to acquired with- the- rule astigmatism or acquired hypermetropia.","Small, inconspicuous and nonsymptomatic chalazia may resolve on its own and may not require any treatment. Chalazion may be managed conservatively or by surgical means."
Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (Cchf),Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF),"Onset of symptoms is sudden, with fever, myalgia, (muscle ache), dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light).","CCHF is caused by virus belongs to family Bunyaviridae, genus Nairovirus. Since it is enveloped virus, it can be readily inactivated. CCHF virus is stable for up to 10 days in blood kept at 400 C.",There are no rapid diagnostic tests.,"CCHF is a severe disease in humans, with a high mortality rate. Treatment for CCHF is primarily supportive."
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (Copd),"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a term used to describe chronic lung diseases that cause limitations in lung airflow. The chronic airflow limitation characteristic of COPD is caused by a mixture of small airway disease (obstructive bronchiolitis) and parenchymal destruction (emphysema), the relative contributions of which vary from person to person.",The most common symptoms of COPD are:,Risk factors for COPD:,"Diagnosis of COPD should be considered in any patient who has symptoms of a chronic cough, sputum production, dyspnoea (difficult or labored breathing) and a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease.",An effective COPD management plan includes four components: (1) assess and monitor disease; (2) reduce risk factors; (3) manage stable COPD; (4) manage exacerbations.
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19),"A cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China on 31 December 2019.  On 7 January, Chinese authority identified a new type of coronavirus as a cause of pneumonia outbreak, which is different from any other human coronaviruses discovered so far. The new strain is named as 2019-nCoV. Afterwards on 11February 2020, this virus is named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and disease is named as COVID-19 by World Health Organisation (WHO).,To date, other six human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified. Out of these, four are globally circulated in the human population and contribute to approximately one-third of common cold infections in humans. The other two viruses are Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS Coronavirus) causing severe respiratory diseases. Coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, are zoonotic, and can be transmitted from animals (civet cats and dromedary camels, respectively) to humans.,(SARS-CoV was first reported in 2002-2003 in Guangdong, China and MERS coronavirus was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012).,The precise zoonotic (animal) origin of the 2019‑nCoV is still uncertain. The virus has been identified in environmental samples from a live animal market in Wuhan, China and some human cases have been epidemiologically linked to this market.,Epidemiological evidence shows that 2019‑nCoV can be transmitted from one individual to another. In the previous outbreaks of other coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV and SARS, human-to-human transmission occurred most commonly through droplets, personal contact, and contaminated objects. The modes of transmission of 2019‑nCoV are similar.,According to WHO, additional investigations are needed to determine how the patients were infected, the extent of human-to-human transmission, the clinical spectrum of disease, and the geographic range of infection.,On 30 January 2020, the Director-General of WHO declared the 2019‑nCoV outbreak a public health emergency of international concern under the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005).,COVID-19 outbreak was declared as pandemic by WHO on 11 March 2020. According to WHO, it is a controllable pandemic and urged all countries to take a comprehensive approach considering their circumstances and with containment measures as the central pillar.",Common symptoms of infection may be in the form of respiratory symptoms such as-,COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. A novel coronavirus is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans. Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that can cause mild illness in the form of common cold to severe respiratory diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).,Two kinds of tests are available for COVID-19 diagnosis: tests for current infection (viral tests-molecular assays) and tests for past infection (antibody tests/serology tests).,"People who think they may have been exposed to COVID-19 should take precautionary measures to prevent further transmission of infection and should be quarantined, and if symptoms appear they should contact their healthcare provider immediately."
Conjunctivochalasis,"Conjunctivochalasis (CCh) is defined as the presence of redundant non-oedematous conjunctiva that may be asymptomatic, or it may be symptomatic due to unstable tear film or mechanical disruption of tear flow. Conjunctivochalasis is usually found in older people and is often overlooked, and is classified as a normal variant of eye due to ageing. However, it has been seen in patients as early as first decade of life with an increase in prevalence and severity with age. It is usually bilateral condition and consists of an elevation of the bulbar conjunctiva over the lower lid margin, most commonly in the infero-temporal region. However, in addition to temporal region, it may involve bulbar conjunctiva along nasal, central lid-margin or any combination of these areas. The presence of loose redundant tissue causes disruption of inferior tear meniscus. This conjunctival prolapse may impede tear outflow through the inferior punctum, resulting in epiphora (watering from eyes).  It may also involve upper bulbar area with loose conjunctiva, but it is less common.",Conjunctivochalasis may be asymptomatic.,"No true aetiology is known for conjunctivochalasis. Senile changes involving the subcutaneous, elastic or supporting tissue in the conjunctiva was suggested as the cause. Eye rubbing, mechanical irritation or trauma to conjunctiva, and abnormal eyelid position were all implicated.","CCh is one of the most common under diagnosed and misdiagnosed ocular surface disease. Non-specific symptoms along with intermittent findings of conjunctival oedema often lead to misdiagnosis. Due to fluctuation in findings of disease process, several clinical exams may be required to confirm the diagnosis. Diagnosis of CCh is mainly clinical.",Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Conjunctival Concretions,"Conjunctival concretions (Conjunctival lithiasis) are small vascular, granular, yellowish-white deposits being produced due to conjunctival degeneration and are found in the sub-epithelium of palpebral conjunctiva and fornix (junction between palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva) in the elderly group or in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions. Deposits were found in patients as young as 20 years old, with the range of occurrence from 30-80 years old. Concretions appear as multiple tiny inclusion cysts containing yellowish-white deposits of inspissated mucous and degenerated epithelial debris including keratin. They are frequently discrete, but confluent concretions are not uncommon. In one study, no significant difference was found between the lacalisation on the upper and lower eyelids, right or left eye, and most of the concretions were superficial and hard, and mainly single. Associated dysfunction of meibomian glands was also noticed in some patients.","Concretions are almost always asymptomatic because they usually remain hidden into the palpebral conjunctiva, not noticed by patients, until they become large and protrude through the palpebral tissues.",Concretions are formed due to the accumulation of epithelial cells and inspissated mucous in depressions called Henle glands.,Diagnosis of conjunctival concretions is often incidental. Patients are usually asymptomatic and conjunctival concretions are noted on ocular examination. Some patients with protruding concretions may complain of irritation and foreign body sensation in eye. Patients may or may not give history of chronic conjunctivitis.,Management of conjunctival concretions:
Congenital Anomalies (Birth Defects),"Congenital anomalies (birth defects) can be defined as structural or functional anomalies (e.g. metabolic disorders) that occur during intrauterine life and can be identified prenatally, at birth or later in life. Congenital anomalies are also known as birth defects, congenital disorders or congenital malformations. Congenital anomalies are the major cause of new born deaths within four weeks of birth and can result in long-term disability with a significant impact on individuals, families, societies and health-care systems.",Some birth defects are clinically apparent at birth; others may only be diagnosed later in life. The structural defect such as spina bifida is obvious at birth whereas haemophilia a functional defect (a bleeding disorder) is not usually obvious until infancy or childhood.,"Approximately in 50 percent of birth defects a specific cause is not known. However, known causes can be divided broadly into two groups:","For the detection of congenital anomalies screening can be done during preconception period, during pregnancy and after child birth.",Management includes:
Cervical Cancer,Cervical cancer,Women with early cervical cancers and pre-cancers usually have no symptom. Symptoms of cervical cancer appear only after the cancer has reached an advanced stage.,There are several risk factors which increase the chances of developing cervical cancer.,Most of the cervical cancer and HPV infections in the early stages show no clinical signs and symptoms; precancerous lesions and early cancers can be detected by screening tests.,"If abnormal cells or lesions detected during screening tests, treatment is needed to excise them. It includes cryotherapy (destroying abnormal tissue on the cervix by freezing it) or Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) when the patient is not eligible for cryotherapy."
Colorectal Cancer,Colorectal cancer is the cancer of colon and rectum. Colorectal cancer is related to large intestine. Colon forms the major part of large intestine.   Rectum is lower part of  large intestine which joins colon with anus.   Cancer may begin as small polyp.Colorectal cancer is more common in western countries.,The symptoms of colorectal cancer include,"Though the exact cause of colorectal cancer is unknown, risk factors which may contribute to the disease are:",Colorectal cancer may be diagnosed by:,
Crimean Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (Cchf),Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF),"Onset of symptoms is sudden, with fever, myalgia, (muscle ache), dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light).","CCHF is caused by virus belongs to family Bunyaviridae, genus Nairovirus. Since it is enveloped virus, it can be readily inactivated. CCHF virus is stable for up to 10 days in blood kept at 400 C.",There are no rapid diagnostic tests.,"CCHF is a severe disease in humans, with a high mortality rate. Treatment for CCHF is primarily supportive."
Chemical Injuries To The Eyes,"Chemical Injuries to the Eye constitutes an ophthalmic emergency, due to the potential for permanent visual impairment and threat to the structural integrity of the eye. Severe injury may result in widespread damage to the ocular surface epithelium.",Most common immediate symptoms are:,"More than 25,000 chemical products with the potential to cause chemical eye injuries have been identified, many of which may be classified as acids or bases, oxidising or reducing agents, or corrosives. Acids and bases are the most frequently implicated chemical agents. The severity of the injury is related to the nature, concentration, quantity and pH of the chemical involved. It also depends upon the duration of contact and surface area of exposure. History of high-velocity (explosive) chemical injury should always raise suspicion of an associated intraocular foreign body.",The severity of eye injury depends upon:,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19),"A cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China on 31 December 2019.  On 7 January, Chinese authority identified a new type of coronavirus as a cause of pneumonia outbreak, which is different from any other human coronaviruses discovered so far. The new strain is named as 2019-nCoV. Afterwards on 11February 2020, this virus is named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and disease is named as COVID-19 by World Health Organisation (WHO).,To date, other six human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified. Out of these, four are globally circulated in the human population and contribute to approximately one-third of common cold infections in humans. The other two viruses are Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS Coronavirus) causing severe respiratory diseases. Coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, are zoonotic, and can be transmitted from animals (civet cats and dromedary camels, respectively) to humans.,(SARS-CoV was first reported in 2002-2003 in Guangdong, China and MERS coronavirus was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012).,The precise zoonotic (animal) origin of the 2019‑nCoV is still uncertain. The virus has been identified in environmental samples from a live animal market in Wuhan, China and some human cases have been epidemiologically linked to this market.,Epidemiological evidence shows that 2019‑nCoV can be transmitted from one individual to another. In the previous outbreaks of other coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV and SARS, human-to-human transmission occurred most commonly through droplets, personal contact, and contaminated objects. The modes of transmission of 2019‑nCoV are similar.,According to WHO, additional investigations are needed to determine how the patients were infected, the extent of human-to-human transmission, the clinical spectrum of disease, and the geographic range of infection.,On 30 January 2020, the Director-General of WHO declared the 2019‑nCoV outbreak a public health emergency of international concern under the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005).,COVID-19 outbreak was declared as pandemic by WHO on 11 March 2020. According to WHO it is a controllable pandemic and urged all countries to take a comprehensive approach considering their circumstances and with containment measures as the central pillar.",Common symptoms of infection may be in the form of respiratory symptoms such as-,A novel coronavirus is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans. Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that can cause mild illness in the form of common cold to severe respiratory diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).,Two kinds of tests are available for COVID-19 diagnosis: tests for current infection (viral tests-molecular assays) and tests for past infection (antibody tests/serology tests).,"There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for 2019-nCoV infection. People infected with 2019-nCoV should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions."
Computer Vision Syndrome,"Computer vision syndrome (CVS), also referred to as digital eye strain, describes eye and vision-related problems that result from prolonged computer, tablet, e-reader and cell phone use. Many individuals experience eye discomfort and vision problems when viewing digital screens. The level of discomfort appears to increase with the amount of digital screen use.",Symptoms of CVS may include:,Risk factors for CVS include:,Diagnosis depends upon the symptoms being faced by the patients and the clinical features.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Child Maltreatment (Child Abuse),"Child maltreatment is abuse to children under 18 years of age by a parent, caregiver, or another person in a custodial role (e.g., clergy, coach, teacher). World Health Organization (WHO) defines child maltreatment as all types of physical and/or emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect, negligence and commercial or other exploitation, which results in actual or potential harm to the child’s health, survival, development or dignity in the context of a relationship of responsibility, trust or power. Child maltreatment can be distinguished in to:","Specific signs and symptoms depend on the type of abuse and can vary. Symptoms can be physical, psychological, or both.",Some factors can increase the risk for abuse or neglect. The presence of these factors does not always mean that maltreatment will occur.,"If there is suspicion of child abuse a detailed account of the events leading to the injury should be obtained and documented. The child should be fully undressed, and the whole body should be examined thoroughly, including the anogenital region. The growth parameters should also be measured. Child abuse may be suspected when-","If child abuse is suspected, report it immediately to concerned person."
Congenital Capillary Haemangioma Of Eyelid,Congenital Capillary haemangioma of eyelid (strawberry naevus) is a common vascular hamartoma in infants/children and is derived from endothelial rests.,Congenital capillary haemangioma may present as,"Congenital capillary haemangioma, one of the common orbital tumour in children, represents a vascular hamartoma derived from endothelial rests.","Clinically, superficial congenital capillary haemangiomas initially present as a red flat lesion with telangiectatic blood vessels. When enlarged, they become elevated, red, dome shaped mass having soft consistency. The masses are compressible and blanch with pressure.",Conservative management
Cavernous Haemangioma Of Eyelid,"Cavernous Haemangioma of Eyelid is a hamartoma, which arises usually after the second decade of life. Eyelid lesion is less common as compared to orbital tumour. It usually accompanies the orbital tumour and the occurrence of isolated eyelid lesion is rare.","Cavernous haemangioma may present with dark blue, compressible, lobulated lesion which increases slowly in size.",Cavernous haemangioma represents hamartoma.,"Clinically, superficial lesions are lobulated, compressible, dark blue coloured, and slowly progressive lesions. These lesions may produce amblyopia due to mass effect of ptosis or from astigmatism produced by ocular compression.","Spontaneous regression of cavernous haemangioma has been reported, but it is more characteristic of capillary haemangioma."
Corneal Abrasion,"Corneal Abrasion is superficial disruption of corneal epithelial surface, usually produced by trauma. Many corneal abrasions, are prevented due to inherent brisk protective reflexes, like closure of eyelids. Corneal abrasion is also prone to infection, like any other soft tissue injury. Corneal abrasions are more common among older children who wear contact lenses for visual improvement.",Symptoms of corneal abrasion include,Causes include,Diagnosis depends upon clinical examination under slit- lamp. Examination may also be conducted using a portable source of ultra-violet light such as Wood’s lamp.,Management includes
Chalcosis,"Chalcosis or chalcosis bulbi refers to mild ocular inflammation due to an intraocular foreign body containing copper between about 70 to 85%. Chalcosis results in deposition of copper on lens capsule (sunflower cataract), Descemet’s membrane (Kayser- Fleischer ring), iris (green discolouration), sluggish pupillary response, vitreous degeneration and liquefaction, yellow retinal plaques and degeneration.","Symptoms vary according to the size, location and content of copper in intraocular foreign body.",Copper containing foreign bodies are the most common non-magnetic foreign bodies.,Diagnosis is based on clinical features such as,Management involves
Commotio Retinae,Commotio Retinae or Berlin’s Oedema is grey-white discolouration of the retina due to disruption of outer segment photoreceptor layer following blunt trauma. This is caused due to contrecoup injury. Shock waves caused due to impact traverses the fluid- filled eye and then strike retina.,Symptoms,"Commotio retinae is caused due to pressure waves emanating from blunt trauma to the eye resulting in retinal injury. There may also be associated choroidal rupture or retinal haemorrhage. Following acute episode of oedema, retina may develop scarring and pigment dispersal. Macular commotio retinae reduces central vision. The vision usually improves on resolution of oedema, unless there is development of macular hole or disruption of retinal pigment epithelium of the fovea.",Diagnosis depends upon the history of injury to the eye and clinical features.,"There is no approved medical therapy for commotio retinae. The patient should be observed closely during first few days to weeks following trauma, to monitor development of any complication and its treatment thereof."
Cavities,Cavities commonly called as “Tooth decay” is damage to the outer protective layer of the tooth i.e. enamel.,"In the beginning, there may not be any symptom at all. As the decay extends, it may cause signs and symptoms:",Main causes and risk factors for tooth decay are:,,
Cleft Lip And Cleft Palate,INTRODUCTION,SYMPTOMS,CAUSES,DIAGNOSIS,
Diarrhea,,Diarrhea is associated with symptoms depending on the cause and who is affected.,Diarrhoea usually occurs when fluid cannot be absorbed from the contents of   bowel or when extra fluid is secreted into   bowel causing watery faeces.,The following diarrhoeal conditions should be further investigated:,Drink fluids : It is important to drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration.
Deafness,"As per WHO, ‘A person who is not able to hear as well as someone with normal hearing – hearing thresholds of 25 decibel(a unit to measure intensity of sound) or better in both ears – is said to have hearing loss’.   Hearing impaired people can be hard of hearing (HOH) or deaf. ‘Hard of hearing’ refers to people with hearing loss ranging from mild to severe. They usually communicate through spoken language. If a person cannot hear at all, then they have deafness. They are unable to hear and understand even a shouted voice.",Early signs and symptoms of hearing loss may include:,The causes of hearing loss and deafness can be either  congenital or  acquired,One should visit doctor as soon as they have hearing problem. The doctor may examine your ear with an instrument called auriscope  to look for anything abnormal.,Treatment  depends upon the cause of the condition like:
Dementia,"Dementia is an illness of old age, usually characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive functions from the previous level. Loss of memory for the recent events is a classical feature. A number of cognitive functions including new learning, intelligence, decision making, executive functioning and language are affected, besides the memory.  In the later stages, the patient may not even be able to take care of self, and the illness affects the basic personal and social skills.,Advances in the medical field have been associated with increase in  life expectancy leading to increasing number of   old age population. As per the 2011 census, India is home to about 65 million people of age 65 and   above, constituting 5.5% of the total population. Prevalence of dementia in India is reported to be 2.7%. As the age increase, prevalence of dementia increases. For example, nearly 20% of people above 80 suffer from dementia. Mean age of presentation is relatively younger at 66.3 years  in India, about 10 years lesser than in the developed countries.,Unlike the West, in India most of the elderly people live with their families and most patients with dementia are taken care of by the families. With the increasing elderly population and reducing joint family system in our country, dementia poses a great challenge.","One of the earliest symptoms of dementia is impairment of memory for recent events. Onset is usually slow and gradual, though it is sudden in vascular dementia. There is a progressive deterioration of various intellectual abilities. Often the family members observe that the patient starts forgetting about his daily use belongings, such as purse, pen or shoes and about recent events and whom he met the day before. He forgets about conversations, events of the day, telephone numbers, etc. A distinguishing feature is that the person himself is often not aware of this development.  Interestingly, memory for remote events even going back to his early life is preserved.","Dementia is a result of degenerative changes in the brain. The most common causes of dementia are Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, fronto-temporal dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies. One study from India analyzing types of dementia found Alzheimer’s disease in 38.3%, vascular dementia in 25.4%, fronto-temporal dementia in 18.7%, diffuse Lewy body disease in 8.9%, and mixed dementia in 8.6% of the patients. In dementia, the brain cells tend to degenerate and die more rapidly than the normal ageing process.,Some of the important characteristics of these different types of dementia are discussed as below:","Any patient developing memory disturbance or personality deterioration in the age group above 50, occurring over a period of few months needs to consult the physician, psychiatrist or neurologist. The person needs to be examined in detail to rule out dementia.  Mini Mental Sate Examination (MMSE) or its Hindi adaptation called Hindi Mental Status Examination (HMSE) are commonly used to screen for dementia. Both can be administered in a clinic setting and take about 10 minutes.,Detailed physical and neurological examination is conducted. The person needs to be investigated  for basic haematology, liver function, kidney function, thyroid, nutritional deficiencies especially vitamin B12 and folate. Sometimes, nutritional deficiencies or hypothyroidism may be responsible for the dementing changes. Once corrected, the memory disturbance improves. Similarly chronic alcohol use can also lead to dementia.,A CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scan) are also performed to detect the degenerative changes. Diagnosis of dementia is, however, mainly clinical.","Dementia, being a degenerative illness, is mostly untreatable. Investigations are generally performed to find out a treatable cause, which if identified (e.g., hypothyroidism, vitamin deficiency ), can be corrected. Certain measures like good nutrition, regular exercise and adequate sleep can improve the quality of life of the patient, and also help in slowing the progression of disease. Simplifying activities or modifying expectations to the cognitive and skill level of the patient can eliminate frustration. The home environment may need to be modified (lighting, positioning of bed, toilets, etc) to compensate for the patient's deficits.,The family members caring for the patient with dementia also face tremendous stress and burden in the care giving role and also need psychological support, guidance and help. They need to be educated about the problem and guided how to deal with it. Family therapy, group therapy and counselling are used to help them. Some of the NGOs like HelpAge India also run self  help groups.,Certain medications like donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine (also called cholinesterase inhibitors) are useful in early stages of the Alzheimer’s disease, and slow down the progress of dementia. These increase the acetylcholine levels in the brain. Memantine is another drug which improves symptoms."
Dengue Fever,,,"Dengue virus is an RNA virus. Transmission of this virus occurs in a cycle. An infected human is bitten by a female mosquito. The infected mosquito then bites another human, and the cycle continues.",A probable diagnosis is based on occurrence of fever along with some of the following symptoms.,"There is no specific medication for treatment of a dengue infection. Persons suspected of dengue can use analgesics (pain relievers) and avoid those containing aspirin. They should take plenty of fluids, rest and consult a physician at the earliest possible. If condition does not improve after 3-5 days, then one should seek further medical advice."
Diabetes Mellitus,"Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic diseases in which the person has high blood glucose (blood sugar) level either due to inadequate insulin production or because the body's cells do not respond properly to insulin or both. The term ""Diabetes Mellitus"" describes a metabolic disorder of multiple etiology characterized by chronic hyperglycemia with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat (dyslipidaemia) and protein metabolism resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. The main symptoms are: -",The main symptoms of diabetes are:,"Type 1 Diabetes: The immune system of body attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin. As no insulin is produced, glucose levels further increase, which can seriously damage the body's organs. Type 1 diabetes is often known as insulin-dependent diabetes. It is also sometimes known as juvenile diabetes or early-onset diabetes because it usually develops before the age of 40, often during the teenage years. Type 1 diabetes is less common than type 2 diabetes.",The clinical diagnosis of diabetics is often prompted by symptoms such as increased thirst and urination and recurrent infections.,"Currently, six classes of oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) are available: biguanides (e.g., metformin), sulfonylureas (e.g., glimepiride), meglitinides (e.g., repaglinide), thiazolidinediones (e.g., pioglitazone), dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors (e.g., sitagliptin), and α-glucosidase inhibitors (e.g., acarbose)."
Down'S Syndrome,"Down syndrome (DS) or Down's syndrome is also known as trisomy 21. It is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of extra chromosome 21 .It is typically associated with a delay in cognitive ability (mental retardation or MR) and physical growth and a particular set of facial characteristics.,The average IQ of young adults with Down syndrome is around 50 whereas young adults without the condition typically have an IQ of 100.",People with Down syndrome share a number of physical characteristics. Not everyone suffering from the syndrome will have all of them but they may include:,"Down syndrome is a genetic condition that occurs as a result of an extra chromosome (chromosome 21). Usually, cells contain 46 chromosomes. 23 are inherited from the mother and 23 from the father. People with Down syndrome, may contain 47 chromosomes as there is an extra copy of chromosome 21. The additional genetic material causes physical and developmental characteristics associated with Down syndrome. There are three forms of Down syndrome, although the effects of each type are usually similar.",Antenatal/ Pre natal screening: Pregnant women of any age should be offered screening for genetic conditions such as Down syndrome. Antenatal screening is a way of assessing the likelihood of baby developing or already having developed an abnormality during pregnancy. The screening test used for Down syndrome is known as the ‘combined test’. It includes a blood test and ultrasound scan.,"There is no cure for the down's syndrome yet but there is much that can be done to help someone with the condition to lead a healthy, active and more independent life. Management strategies such as:"
Dacryoadenitis,Dacryoadenitis is an inflammation of the lacrimal gland. Dacryoadenitis may be acute or chronic.,Symptoms at presentation depend upon whether the disease process is acute or chronic.,The causes of lacrimal gland inflammation may be classified as:-,Diagnosis is based on the clinical presentation of the patient and the supportive tests being conducted.,Management of the disease should be under medical supervision.
Diabetic Retinopathy,Diabetes mellitus is caused due to lack or diminished effectiveness of endogenous insulin and is characterised by hyperglycaemia.,Patients are generally asymptomatic in the initial stages of the disease.,"Diabetic retinopathy occurs in patients with Diabetes mellitus, more so in IDDM.","Patients have increased fasting and postprandial (taken two hours after meals) blood sugar levels. Glycosylated or glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is a measure of glycaemic control over the last three months. Besides, patients have systemic features of Diabetes mellitus.",It should be strictly carried out under medical supervision.
Duane Retraction Syndrome,Duane retraction syndrome is characterised by retraction of globe (eyeball) on attempted adduction (inward movement) caused due to co-contraction of both medial and lateral rectus muscle of the involved eye.,Duane retraction syndrome may be associated with some or all of the following features:,"Duane retraction syndrome is thought to be due to aberrant innervations of medial and lateral rectus muscles. In addition, structural anomalies of the muscle or primary anomaly of the brainstem may be contributing as aetiological factors. Most likely, both genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of this syndrome.",Patient may present with:,Non surgical management:

Diphtheria,Diphtheria,"The illness has an acute onset and the main characteristics are sore throat, low fever and swollen glands in the neck,","Diphtheria is caused by bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheria. This is gram positive and non motile organism. It has no invasive power, but produces a powerful exotoxin. Diptheria bacilli are readily killed by heat and chemical agents.",Diagnosis of diphtheria is usually made on the basis of clinical presentation since it is imperative to begin presumptive therapy quickly.,Treatment involves administering diphtheria antitoxin to neutralize the effects of the toxin and antibiotics to kill the bacteria.
Dracunculiasis (Guinea-Worm Disease),"Dracunculiasis (guinea-worm disease) is a parasitic disease caused by Dracunculus medinensis that is a long, thread-like worm. Dracunculiasis is commonly known as guinea-worm disease (GW). It is transmitted exclusively when people drink stagnant water contaminated with parasite-infected water fleas (Cyclops- that carry infective guinea-worm larvae).",People do not usually have symptoms until about one year after they become infected with parasite.,"Cause, transmission, life cycle and incubation period:","Clinical presentation of guinea –worm disease is so typical and well known to local people in endemic areas that it is sufficient to make diagnosis.,Examination of the fluid discharged by the worm can show rhabditiform larvae.,No serologic test is available.",There is no drug to treat Guinea worm disease and nor any vaccine to prevent infection.
Disabilities,"Disability is a global public health problem as people with disability, throughout the life course, face widespread barriers in accessing health and related services, such as rehabilitation, and has worse health outcomes than people without disability. Disability is any continuing condition that restricts everyday activities. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) defines disability as an umbrella term for impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions. Impairment is a problem in body function or structure; an activity limitation is a difficulty encountered by an individual in executing a task or action; participation restriction is a problem experienced by an individual in involvement in life situations.",General symptoms for a disabled person according to type of disability-,Risk factors for the disabilities:,Diagnosis of particular disability may be done at health care centre with the help of a specialist. A concerned medical authority in Government hospital can issue a disability certificate*.,"Increasing evidence suggests that, as a group, people with disabilities experience poorer levels of health than the general population. By improving access to quality, affordable health care services, health outcomes for people with disabilities can be improved. Primary health-care services with the support of specialists can provide health services to people with disability. Health services should be focused for the following health conditions:"
Dermatochalasis,"Dermatochalasis is a term that is defined as excess upper and/or lower eyelid skin. The eyelid skin is thin and prone to fine wrinkling. Redundant skin is often associated with fat herniation, descent of eyebrows, and descent of mid-face. Fat herniation is most common in the superomedial region and in the inferomedial and central part. In addition, variable puffiness due to eyelid oedema and discolouration from venous leakage (black circles under eyes) develop with age. It is a common condition and is seen in elderly persons, but occasionally in young adults also. It is more common in the upper eyelid but may be seen in the lower eyelids as well.",Dermatochalasis may be asymptomatic. It is usually a bilateral condition.,"Dermatochalasis is due to age-related loss of skin elasticity and weakening of the connective tissue of the eyelid, usually seen in elderly.",Diagnosis depends upon the clinical features.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Distichiasis,"Distichiasis is a congenital or acquired condition in which there is an accessory row of cilia behind the normal row of eyelash cilia. This disorder may be familial in origin with an autosomal dominant inheritance, but may also be produced by acquired conditions such as severe inflammation or trauma. It is presumed to be due to differentiation of primary epithelial germ cells originally destined for development of meibomian or tarsal glands. Meibomian glands are modified sebaceous glands located in the tarsal plate of eyelids. In skin, pilo-sebaceous unit consists of sebaceous glands associated with hair follicle and sweat gland. It is believed that meibomian gland may undergo differentiation into primitive pilo-sebaceous unit which produces distichiasis.",Symptoms of distichiasis may include,Distichiasis may be congenital or acquired.,Diagnosis depends upon slit-lamp examination by an eye-specialist.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Double Elevator Palsy,"Double Elevator Palsy refers to limited elevation of one eye in adduction, primary gaze, and abduction. The term double elevator refers to both the elevators of an eye i.e. superior rectus and inferior oblique muscle. However, there are cases in which deficient elevation is produced by tight inferior rectus muscle. Due to this, Double elevator palsy is included under restrictive strabismus. Now Double elevator palsy is known by a more descriptive term as Monocular Elevation Deficit Syndrome (MED).This is distinguished from Brown’s syndrome in which elevation is restricted much more in adduction rather than in abduction.",Symptoms of MED includes,Causes may include congenital and acquired cases.,Diagnosis depends upon history and clinical examination.,Management is not required in all cases of MED.
Digit-Sucking (Thumb/ Finger-Sucking),"One of the commonest oral habits is sucking, a reflex present at birth. Developing an oral habit is considered a natural phenomenon in children upto a certain age. It is a sign of natural growth and development of a child which stops without any intervention. But, the duration, frequency and intensity of these natural habits, if continue for longer, can alter normal development of oral and facial anatomy. Sucking habits could be nutritive (breast and bottle feeding) or non-nutritive. The commonest form of non-nutritive sucking (NNS) is digit sucking.","Displacement of front teeth leading to proclined upper incisors.,Lower front teeth are tipped back on the lingual side.,Increased length of tooth that is visible in the oral cavity.,Spacing between teeth is also increased (Diastema).,Gap between upper and lower front teeth when closing mouth.,Upper jaw becomes narrow and does not fit properly with the lower jaw.,Speech problems may also occur like difficulty in pronouncing ‘S’.,Physical problems like nail infections, sore digit skin etc.,Incompetent lips closure.,Hyperactive lower lip due to increased movement of facial muscle (Orbicularis Oris).",Digit-sucking starts as a natural part of the development process. It makes babies feel satisfied and may also help them to feel secure and fall asleep.,"History- Frequency, duration and intensity of the digit-sucking is inquired from parents.",Psychological therapy-

Medication used to treat atopic eczema most commonly includes:"
Endometriosis,"Endometriosis is the abnormal growth of cells (endometrial cells) similar to those that form the inside of the uterus, but in a location outside of the uterus. It can grow in the fallopian tubes, ovaries, bladder, bowel, vagina or rectum.",A major symptom of endometriosis is recurring pelvic pain:,"Retrograde Menstruation: The theory of retrograde menstruation (also called the implantation theory or transplantation theory) is the most widely accepted theory for the formation of ectopic endometrium in endometriosis . It proposes that during a woman's menstrual flow, some of the endometrial debris exits the uterus through the fallopian tubes and attaches itself to the peritoneal surface (the lining of the abdominal cavity) where it can proceed to invade the tissue as endometriosis.",A medical history and a physical examination can in many patients lead the physician to suspect endometriosis .,"While there is no cure for endometriosis, management can be done to ease the symptoms:"
Epilepsy,"As per WHO, epilepsy is a chronic disorder characterized by recurrent seizures which may vary from a brief lapse of attention or muscle jerks, to severe and prolonged convulsions.","The main symptoms of epilepsy are repeated seizures. There are many different types of seizures, depending on the area of the brain affected. Seizures can be classified into 2 categories depending on how much of the brain is affected. There are:","Exact cause of epilepsy is still unknown but it is thought that it results from excess neuronal firing/activity. Epilepsy is caused when there are disruptions to the normal connections between nerve cells in the brain (much like disruptions in wiring of a complex electrical circuit), when there are imbalances of natural chemicals or neurotransmitters that are important to the signaling among nerve cells, or when there are changes in the membranes of nerve cells, including proteins called ion channels, that alter their normal sensitivity.p","The diagnosis of epilepsy usually requires that the seizures should occur spontaneously.Other precipitants can trigger an epileptic seizure in patients who otherwise would be susceptible to spontaneous seizures commonest are missing epilepsy medication dose, lack ofsleep, stress, taking certain medication which may precipitate seizures. Rarely  certain epilepsy syndromes require particular triggers for seizures to occur. These are termed reflex epilepsy. For example, patients with primary reading epilepsy have seizures triggered by reading Photosensitive epilepsy can be limited to seizures triggered by flashing lights.","Epilepsy is usually treated with medication prescribed by a physician; primary caregivers, neurologists, and neurosurgeons  all frequently care for people with epilepsy. However, it has been stressed that accurate differentiation between generalized and partial seizures is especially important in determining the appropriate treatment. The mainstay of treatment of epilepsy is anti convulsant medications. However many a times it has certain effect on quality of life."
Ectropion,"Ectropion is an abnormal eversion (outward turning) of the eyelid margin away from globe. Primarily, it involves lower eye lid but upper lid eversion may occur in Floppy eyelid syndrome. Ectropion produces symptoms due to ocular (pertaining to eye) exposure and inadequate lubrication of eyeball. It may cause epiphora, chronic conjunctivitis, conjunctival hypertrophy, exposure keratopathy or even visual loss.","Symptoms are due to irritation of anterior ocular surface, being produced by outward turning of eyelid margin, thereby resulting in exposure of eyeball.",Causes vary according to the type of ectropion:,Diagnosis depends upon elucidation of causative factors and clinical examination.,Management should be under medical supervision.
Entropion,"Entropion is an abnormality resulting in inversion (inward turning) of the eyelid margin. Entropion causes irritation to the exposed surface of the eyeball. Entropion can damage conjunctival and corneal surface which may lead to corneal abrasion, scarring, corneal thinning or neovascularisation. Advanced cases may develop corneal ulceration or even perforation.","Symptoms are due to irritation of anterior ocular (pertaining to eye) surface, being produced by inward turning of eyelid margin.",Involutional Entropion:,Diagnosis depends upon elucidation of causative factors and clinical examination.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis,"Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) is a highly contagious viral conjunctivitis caused by a group of viruses known as adenoviruses. Adenovirus serotypes 8, 19 and 37 are often associated with EKC. Family of adenoviruses contain different serotypes that can also cause pharyngoconjunctival fever, non-specific sporadic follicular conjunctivitis and chronic papillary conjunctivitis. In addition to infections of ocular (pertaining to eye) surface, adenovirus (mainly those responsible for paryngoconjunctival fever) is responsible for causing infectious diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and respiratory system. EKC is reported worldwide and has a tendency to occur in epidemics.","Symptoms of EKC may begin following an eye examination and spread in a clinic, exposure within the family or at work.","EKC is caused by adenoviruses and more than 50 serotypes have been isolated. There are at-least 19 documented serotypes which causes EKC. Most commonly associated serotypes include adenovirus 8, 19 and 37. Less commonly, EKC may be caused by serotypes 2 to 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14, 16, 21 and 29.",Diagnosis of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis usually depends upon the characteristic clinical features.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Epibulbar Dermoids,"Epibulbar dermoids are benign congenital tumours that contain choristomatous tissue (choristomas are congenital overgrowth of normal tissue in abnormal locations). Most frequent site for epibulbar dermoid is inferior-temporal part of limbus (junction between cornea and conjunctiva). Occasionally, dermoid may be present entirely within cornea or may be localised to conjunctiva. Choristomas consist of ectodermal and mesodermal tissues in varying proportion and may contain epidermal appendages, skin, sweat gland, connective tissue, muscle, tooth, fat, lacrimal gland, bone, cartilage, vascular or neurologic tissue.",Epibulbar dermoids are present at birth but may be recognised during first or second decade of life. These appear to enlarge as a person matures.,Most of the cases of epibulbar dermoids are sporadic and no relation is found with any known toxin or irritant.,Diagnosis of dermoid depends upon the clinical presentation.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Epidemic Dropsy,"Epidemic dropsy is an acute non-infectious disease resulting from use of edible oils adulterated with Argemone mexicana (mexican poppy) seed oils. It occurs as an epidemic (unusual occurrence of  disease above what is normally expected in that population in that area) form in places where mustard oil  is commonly used as cooking mediums as in North, North-Western and North- Eastern states of India, generally sparing South Indian states where the predominant cooking oil is coconut oil. In Western Rajasthan, India a small outbreak was reported from consumption of contaminated sesame seeds oil with Argemone Mexicana.",The disease is mostly reported in epidemic form but sporadic cases were also reported. Both sexes were involved equally. Persons of all ages were affected except breastfed infants and small children who have no mustard oil in their diets.,"Epidemic dropsy is a clinical state caused by consuming the edible oil adulterated with Argemone mexicana seed oil that is a native plant of the West Indies, and grows wild in India. It has prickly leaves and bright yellow flowers. In India it is popularly known as Satyanashi.","The diagnosis of epidemic dropsy may be considered during an outbreak of bilateral tender pitting leg oedema in more than one member of a family or community. It should be distinguished from hypoproteinaemic states, filariasis, venous insufficiency, Beriberi, hypothyroidism and nephrotic syndrome. Presence of sanguinarine in blood and urine confirms the diagnosis for epidemic dropsy.",No specific treatment is there for the epidemic dropsy.
Epiblepharon,"Epiblepharon is the presence of a fold in skin and orbicularis oculi muscle of the lower eyelids which may cause eyelashes to rub against the cornea (trichiasis). There is vertical orientation of the eyelashes. It may be associated with weakness of inferior oblique muscle. It usually affects nasal one-third of the lower lid and is usually bilateral. There may be presence of coexistent entropion.  This condition may be seen in upper eyelid as well. This condition may be autosomal dominant or sporadic and is usually common in Asian population. Epiblepharon may be self-limiting in many patients, since it decreases or diminishes with facial growth. The word epi means on and blepharos means eyelid.",About 80% of children with epiblepharon have no ocular complaints.,Epiblepharon may be associated with several causes such as,Epiblepharon is diagnosed based on clinical features.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Epicanthus,"Epicanthus or epicanthal fold is a semi-lunar fold of skin at medial canthus, with its concavity facing outward. The epicanthal fold obscures the view of the medial canthus including caruncle and plica semilunaris. This is the most common congenital lid condition. Epicanthus may be an isolated phenomenon or it may be an associated feature in patients with congenital ptosis (drooping of eyelids), Down’s syndrome or blepharophimosis (shortening of palpebral fissure both horizontally and vertically) syndrome. This condition may be unilateral or bilateral and is most prominent along the upper lid. Although, it is a normal finding in people of Asian ancestry, but is abnormal in non-Asians.",Parents usually bring the child with features such as,Epicanthus mainly results from a relative deficiency of skin in the vertical axis (as opposed to the horizontal axis) within the medial canthal area. It may occur alone or in association with other abnormalities such as,Diagnosis is clinical and depends on the origin and configuration of the free fold.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Euryblepharon,"Euryblepharon is characterised by increased vertical separation of the temporal aspect of the palpebral fissure so that the palpebral conjunctiva is not in apposition with the eye. The enlargement of palpebral fissure is accompanied by variable degree of lower eyelid ectropion. The lower eyelid ectropion is caused by vertical shortening of the lower eyelid relative to the horizontal dimensions of the opposing upper eyelid. In euryblepharon, palpebral apertures are larger than normal and it may be associated with epicanthus. Widening of palpebral fissure may give the appearance of eyelid ptosis.  The eyelids are normally developed but the insertions of the canthal tendons appear to be widely or anteriorly placed. Frequently, the palpebral fissure has downward slant as well because of an inferiorly displaced attachment of the lateral canthal tendon.",Euryblepharon may be unilateral or bilateral. It may present with,Euryblepharon may be inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder or may occur sporadically.,Diagnosis of euryblepharon is based on clinical features.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Ectopic Pregnancy,"Ectopic pregnancy is the leading cause of maternal death in early pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy is defined as implantation of a fertilized egg outside the uterine cavity. In a normal pregnancy, the fertilized egg moves from the fallopian tube into the uterus, where the pregnancy develops. In a small percentage of pregnancies, however, the embryo implants in extra uterine locations leading to an ectopic pregnancy. Most extra uterine pregnancies (97%) implant in the fallopian tube; another 3% of ectopic pregnancies implant in the cervix, ovary, peritoneal cavity, or in uterine scars. In ectopic pregnancy as the pregnancy continues, it can cause the tube to rupture with internal bleeding. This situation can be life threatening and needs to be treated as medical emergency.","It is important to be aware of the symptoms of ectopic pregnancy because it can occur in any sexually active woman whether or not she is using contraceptives or has undergone tubal sterilization (""tying the tubes"").","An ectopic pregnancy is mostly occurs in fallopian tube. A fertilized egg has difficulty passing through a damaged tube, causing the egg to implant and grow in the tube. Adnexal infections or tubal surgery can damage the fallopian tubes. Therefore women who have abnormal fallopian tubes are at higher risk of ectopic pregnancy.",The diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is not always easy; and a delay in diagnosis and treatment can have serious consequences. Early diagnosis can be made before appearance of sign and symptoms.,"In order to minimize the risks to woman’s health/or to the save the woman’s life treatment of ectopic pregnancy is necessary. Options of treatment depend on duration of pregnancy, clinical condition, fertility status, scan results and level of b-hCG."
Exposure Keratopathy,"Exposure keratopathy refers to that surface disorder of the eye in which absence of an adequate tear film results in breakdown of the corneal epithelium. This may produce disruption of corneal epithelium, ulcer formation, superadded infection, thinning and even perforation of eyes in severe cases.",Exposure keratopathy may produce symptoms such as,Exposure keratopathy has numerous causes such as,Diagnosis depends upon clinical history and evaluation.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Eyelid Varix,"Eyelid Varix is an abnormal dilatation of one or more normal blood vessels. Varices of the eyelids are usually an extension forward of the orbital varices into the eyelid. These probably are congenital or acquired weakness of the affected vein, or to an obstruction of the venous circulation.",Eyelid varix may present with symptoms such as,"Eyelid varix is caused probably due to congenital or acquired weakness of the involved vein, or due to obstruction of the venous circulation.",Diagnosis of eyelid varix is clinical.,Eyelid varices may be just observed and followed up in most of the cases.
Early Pregnancy Loss,Early pregnancy loss is non-induced embryonic or fetal death or passage of products of conception before 20 weeks gestation. Early pregnancy loss is also termed as spontaneous abortion or miscarriage. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines it as expulsion or extraction of an embryo or fetus weighing 500 g or less.,Signs and symptoms of spontaneous abortion may be:,"In most of the cases of early pregnancy loss, cause of spontaneous abortion is not known; approximately 50% of all cases of early pregnancy loss are due to fetal chromosomal abnormalities.","A thorough evaluation is needed to make a definitive diagnosis as common symptoms of early pregnancy loss, such as vaginal bleeding and pain in lower abdomen, also are common in normal pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy and molar pregnancy.",Management  depends on the stage of spontaneous abortion.
Eclampsia,"Eclampsia is the onset of fits (convulsions) in a woman whose pregnancy is usually complicated by pre-eclampsia. The fits may occur in pregnancy after 20 weeks gestation, in labour, or during the first 48 hours of the postpartum period. Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia are part of the same disorder with eclampsia being the severe form of the disease.","Eclampsia is the onset of fits in a woman whose pregnancy is usually complicated by pre-eclampsia. The fits may occur in pregnancy after 20 weeks gestation, in labour, or during the first 48 hours of the postpartum period.",The causes of preeclampsia and eclampsia are not known.,"Diagnosis of eclampsia is done with the medical history and clinical examination along with some tests/ investigations. As preeclampsia precedes eclampsia, symptoms and signs of severe preeclampsia should be checked.",Eclampsia is managed with the following steps:
Fracture (Bone Fracture),"Fracture is a medical condition which leads to break in the continuity of the bone. A bone fracture can be the result due to high force impact or stress, or trivial injury as a result of certain medical conditions that weaken the bones, such as osteoporosis, bone cancer, or osteogenesis imperfecta, where the fracture is then properly termed a pathologic fracture.","Fractures can cause,Pain and bleeding,Swelling,Bruising or discolored skin around the affected area,The patient is unable to put weight on the injured area,The patient cannot move the affected area,If it is an open fracture there may be:,Bleeding,Damage to adjacent structures such as nerves or vessels, spinal cord and nerve roots (for spine fractures), or cranial contents (for skull fractures) can cause other specific signs and symptoms.,References:,http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00139,http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000001.htm","The fractures are generally caused due to fall with a great impact or road accident.,Healthy bones are extremely tough and resilient and can withstand powerful impacts. When people enter old age two factors make their risk of fractures greater; weaker bones and a greater risk of falling. Children are physically more active than adults, thus they are more prone to accidents or fall that may result in fractures. People with debilitating illnesses and conditions that may weaken their bones also have a higher risk of fractures. Examples include osteoporosis, infection or a tumor.,Reference:,http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000001.htm,http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00139","A fractured bone can be diagnosed clinically based on the history and the physical examination of the patient.,Imaging by X-ray is often performed to view the bone suspected of being fractured.,In certain suitations, x-ray alone is not sufficient, a computed tomograph (CT scan) or MRI may be performed.,Reference:,http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00139",
Fibroids,Fibroids are non-cancerous tumors that grow in or around the uterus (womb).   Fibroids are also   known as uterine myomas or fibromyomas. Fibroids are made of muscle cells and fibrous   tissues that grow in and around the wall of the   uterus. The cause of fibroids is unknown. Risk factors include being overweight or obese and is mostly seen in African-American. They can grow anywhere in the uterus   and are named according to their origin:,"Many women with fibroids have no symptoms. If symptoms occur  , these   may include:",Fibroid is an overgrowth of smooth muscle cells. The uterus is mainly made of smooth muscle. The exact cause is still not clear.,Physical examination: Some fibroids can be felt during an internal (vaginal) examination by a doctor.,Medicines that are used to treat heavy periods are:
Filariasis,"Filariasis is caused by several round, coiled and thread-like parasitic worms that belongs to the family filaridea. These parasites penetrate the skin either   their own or through the opening created by mosquito bites to reach the lymphatic system.,The disease is caused by the nematode worm, either Wuchereria bancrofti or Brugia malayi and is transmitted by mosquito species Culex quinquefasciatus and Mansonia  annulifera/M.uniformis respectively.,The disease generally presents with the symptoms like swelling of legs, and hydrocele and can cause a raft of societal stigma.,Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) is  commonly known as elephantiasis. It is a disfiguring and disabling disease, which is generally  aquired in childhood. In the early stages,though there are either no symptoms or non-specific symptoms, the lymphatic system is damaged. This stage can last for several years. Infected persons sustain the transmission of the disease. The long term physical consequences are painful swollen limbs (lymphoedema or elephantiasis). Hydrocele in males is also common in endemic areas.,National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme,Filariasis control in India and Its Elimination","Lymphatic filariasis infection involves asymptomatic, acute, and chronic conditions. The majority of infections are asymptomatic, showing no external signs of infection, although their blood is positive for microfilaria. This stage may lasts for months.,Acute episodes of local inflammation involving skin, lymph nodes and lymphatic vessels.,Chronic condition shows  oedema with thickening of the skin and underlying tissues   (the classical symptom of filarasis).,It usually affects the lower extremities. However, the arms, vulva, breasts and scrotum (causing hydrocele formation) can also be affected.The oedema  in the extremities, breast or genital area can result in the part becoming  several times its normal size and is due to blockage of the vessels of the lymphatic system.","Most cases of filariasis are caused by the parasite known as Wuchereria bancrofti.   Culex, Aedes and Anopheles mosquitoes serve as vector for W.bancrofti in  transmission of the disease. Another parasite called Brugia malayi  also causes filariasis is transmitted by the vector Mansonia and Anopheles mosquitoes.,When an infected mosquito bites a healthy person, the larvae called microfilariae move into the lymphatics and lymph nodes.  Here, they develop into adult worms and may persist for years.,The adult parasite, in turn, produces more microfilariae. These microfilariae circulate in the peripheral blood usually in the night, and are sucked by the mosquitoes during a bite.   The same cycle is then repeated in another healthy individual.","Blood sample:,The microfilariae that cause lymphatic filariasis circulate in the blood at night (called nocturnal periodicity). Blood collection should be done at night to coincide with the appearance of the microfilariae, and a thick smear should be made and stained with Giemsa or hematoxylin and eosin. For increased sensitivity, concentration techniques can be used.,Serological examination:,Serologic techniques provide an alternative to microscopic detection of microfilariae for the diagnosis of lymphatic filariasis. Patients with active filarial infection typically have elevated levels of antifilarial IgG4 in the blood and these can be detected using routine assays.,For further diagnosis, consult your physician.","Maintenance of Good hygiene of the affected part prevents the worsening of the lymphoedema and secondary bacterial skin infections.,The affected limb should be kept elevated and regular exercises should be done to improve the lymph flow.,The recommended regimen for treatment of filariasis is   mass drug administration (MDA)  in which a single dose of two medicines are given together - albendazole (400 mg) with  either ivermectin (150-200 mcg/kg) in areas where onchocerciasis (river blindness) is also endemic or diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC) (6 mg/kg ) in areas where onchocerciasis is not endemic. These medicines clear microfilariae from the bloodstream.,Though Lymphatic filariasis is treated with medicines, there is persistent abnormal enlargement of body parts causing pain and severe disability. Associated social stigma makes patients to suffer mentally, socially and financially. Elimination of lymphatic filariasis is possible by stopping the spread of infection with mass drug administration (MDA) and protection from mosquito bites and vector control measures."
Food Poisoning,"Food poisoning is illness that results due to the consumption of food or drink which is contaminated with pathogenic bacteria, viruses, parasites, toxins or chemicals. Most people recover without the need for treatment. In most cases, the food that causes the illness has been contaminated by bacteria, such as salmonella or   Escherichia coli, or a virus, such as the norovirus. The contamination of food can occur at any point beginning from growing, till processing and shipping of the product. Improper cooking of the food may also be the cause for contamination other cause can be when pathogens are transferred from one surface to another especially in case of ready-to-eat foods or raw foods. Since these foods aren’t cooked before consumption, pathogens are not destroyed and ingesting them may lead to food poisoning. This is called cross-contamination. Thus the contamination of food may occur at any stage in the process from food production to consumption.",The symptoms of food poisoning may   begin at any point between few hours and several weeks   after eating contaminated food. They include:,"Food borne illness are usually infectious or toxic in nature and caused by bacteria ,viruses, parasites or chemical substances entering the body  through contaminated food or water arise from improper handling, preparation or storage of food.","Generally detailed history including signs, symptoms and details of food intake are used to diagnose for the food poisoning.Symptoms may include pain in the abdomen, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, fever and signs and symptoms of dehydration (body does not have as much water and fluids as it should)","In most cases of food poisoning, symptoms can be relieved at home without seeing physician."
Frey'S Syndrome,"It is a neurological disorder resulting from damage to or near the parotid glands responsible for making saliva, and from damage to the facial nerve often from surgery .","Redness (erythema),Sweating in the cutaneous distribution of the auriculotemporal nerve usually in response to gustatory stimuli.","It is generally due to the side effects of a surgery of or near parotid glands or may be due to injury to the auriculotemporal nerve, which passes through the parotid gland. As a result of inappropriate regeneration, the parasympathetic nerve fibers may switch course to skin surface, resulting in ""Gustatory sweating"" or sweating in anticipation of eating, instead of the normal salivatory response.",Diagnosis can be done by the doctor based on symptoms.,"There is no effective treatment, but various options are available :"
Frost Bite,"Frostbite is a medical condition involving damage to skin and tissues due to extreme cold. Frostbite is most likely to happen in body parts that are far from the heart or those with large exposed areas to cold weather. The initial stages of frostbite are sometimes called ""frost nip"". A person with frostbite on the arms or legs may also have hypothermia (lowered body temperature). Frostbite can occur when skin is exposed to a temperature of 0 °C (32 °F) or lower, resulting in vasoconstriction. The resultant decrease in blood flow does not deliver sufficient heat to the tissue to prevent the formation of ice crystals. The anatomic sites most susceptible to frostbite include hands, feet, and exposed tissues (eg, ears, nose, and lips).","At or below 0 °C (32 °F), blood vessels close to the skin start to constrict, and blood is shunted away from the extremities via the action of the glomus bodies (glomus bodies are most numerous in the fingers and toes. The role of the glomus body is to shunt blood away from the skin surface when exposed to cold temperature, thus preventing heat loss, and on the other hand, it allows maximum heat flow to the skin in warm weather, to allow heat dissipation. The glomus body has a high sympathetic tone and its potentiation leads to near complete vasoconstriction). There are four degrees of frostbite. Each of these degrees has varying degrees of pain.",Frostbite generally occurs when body is exposed to low temperatures.,Frost bite is generally diagnosed based on the symptoms,It is better to prevent from being exposed to cold by taking necessary precautions.
Filamentary Keratitis,"Filamentary keratitis is a chronic disorder in which filaments, which are adherent complexes of mucus and corneal epithelium, are present on the corneal surface. Filaments consist of a variable combination of degenerated epithelial cells and mucous which are attached to the corneal surface at one end. Filaments present as small, gelatinous strands on the anterior surface of the cornea and may vary in size, shape, composition, and distribution.",Patient with Filamentary keratitis may have ocular (eye) symptoms like:,Filamentary keratitis is associated with a number of conditions or diseases associated with the ocular surface.,"Diagnosis of filamentary keratitis is based on the clinical history and slit lamp examination (bio-microscopy), being conducted by an eye specialist.",Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Fluorosis,"Fluorosis is a crippling disease resulted from deposition of fluorides in the hard and soft tissues of body. It is a public health problem caused by excess intake of fluoride through drinking water/food products/industrial pollutants over a long period. Ingestion of excess fluoride, most commonly in drinking-water affects the teeth and bones.","It is not necessary that all symptoms are present at the same time. The severity and duration, (which is often episodic), depend on a person’s age, nutritional status, environment, kidney function, amount of fluoride ingested, genetic background, tendency to allergies, and other factors such as hardness of the water due to presence of calcium and magnesium.","Fluorosis is caused by excessive intake of fluorides from multiple sources such as in food, water, air (due to gaseous industrial waste), and excessive use of toothpaste. However, drinking water is the most significant source.","All the substances containing fluoride should be avoided during diagnosis. If the symptoms are caused by fluoride, they should diminish markedly within a week and largely disappear within several weeks. Gastrointestinal symptoms settle within 15 days.","There is no treatment for severe cases of skeletal fluorosis, only efforts can be made towards reducing the disability which has occurred. However, the disease is easily preventable if diagnosed early and steps are taken to prevent intake of excess fluoride through provision of safe drinking water, promote nutrition and avoid foods with high fluoride content. Dental and skeletal fluorosis is irreversible and no treatment exists, the only remedy is prevention by keeping fluoride intake with in safe limits."
Floppy Eyelid Syndrome,"Floppy eyelid syndrome (FES) is frequently an unrecognised cause of chronic, non-infectious unilateral or bilateral papillary conjunctivitis. It is characterised by loose floppy eyelids associated with punctate epithelial keratopathy (PEK), ptosis of lateral eyelashes and typical conjunctival changes.","The syndrome is characterised by a triad of diffuse papillary conjunctivitis, a loose upper eyelid which everts readily (positive lid eversion sign), and a soft rubbery tarsus which may be folded on itself. It may be associated with lash ptosis, which usually involves lateral lashes of the upper eyelid.",Various causes have been implicated as aetiological factors.,Diagnosis depends upon,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Factitious Keratoconjunctivitis,Factitious Keratoconjunctivitis is a difficult diagnosis to make and is often missed when not suspected. It should be considered in any case in which sustained trauma occurs in poorly explained or suspicious circumstances. The term factitious disorders describe conditions where physical findings are intentionally produced by person to assume sick role.,Symptoms may be disproportionate to the clinical signs. Patients usually seek multiple medical advises over an extended period of time. These may be with varying complaints and from different treating physicians.,Conjunctival inflammation in factitious keratoconjunctivitis is produced by self-inflicted physical or chemical injury. It may occur in context of a psychiatric illness.,Diagnosis depends upon clinical features since history of self-inflicted injury may not be available. Differential diagnosis helps in reaching to a conclusive diagnosis.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Fibromyalgia,"Fibromyalgia is chronic neurological disorder that involves widespread pain, tenderness, fatigue, and other symptoms. It is common in middle-aged women but can affect patients of either sex and at any age. 2-4 percent of people may be affected by fibromyalgia. The term fibromyalgia means pain in muscles and fibrous tissues (tendons and ligaments).",Fibromyalgia is a syndrome combined with several signs and symptoms that includes:,"The exact cause of fibromyalgia is not clear. It is not an autoimmune, inflammatory, joint, or muscle disorder; though some factors such as spine problem, arthritis, injury, or other type of physical stress even emotional stress may trigger this illness.","There is no diagnostic test for fibromyalgia; therefore disease is diagnosed by examining the patient, evaluating symptoms, and ruling out other conditions. There are some conditions that can be confused with fibromyalgia such as hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyalgia rheumatica and other inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Physical findings and blood tests will help the medical expert to differentiate these diseases.","Management of fibromyalgia involves a combination of medications, stress management, exercise and rest with enough sleep. There is no cure for fibromyalgia. However, symptoms can be treated with both non-drug measures and medication based treatments. Many times the best outcomes are achieved by using multiple types of treatments."
Female Genital Mutilation,,"Procedures can cause severe bleeding and problems urinating, and later cysts, infections, as well as complications in childbirth and increased risk of newborn deaths.",Who is at risk?,Health-care providers working in regions where FGM is a common practice and those seeing patients from these regions should always include direct questions about FGM-related gynaecological and urogenital complications when taking a medical history from their female patients1.  As girls and women living with FGM often do not seek care for such type of symptoms until the symptoms are advanced or cannot be hidden.,"Health-care providers play an important role in the treatment and care of the girls and women around the world living with female genital mutilation1,3."
Gangrene,"Gangrene is a condition that arises when a considerable mass of body tissue dies (necrosis) . This may occur after an injury or infection, or in people suffering from any chronic health problem affecting blood circulation. Gangrene is primarily caused due to reduced blood supply to the affected tissues that leads to cell death. Diseases like diabetes and long-term smoking increases the risk of gangrene. It can affect any part of the body but typically starts in the toes, feet, fingers and hands (the extremities).","Dry gangrene which is the most common type of gangrene, usually manifests in the following form.",Gangrene is caused when a body part loses its blood supply due to an injury or an underlying disease. The conditions most commonly responsible for causing gangrene are as follows:,Clinical tests can be carried out to confirm the diagnosis of gangrene. These include:,"Although Gangrene can be managed by its symptomatic treatment, yet it is also necessary to diagnose and treat the underlying cause. The symptomatic treatment is as follows:"
Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (Gerd),"Gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic symptom of mucosal damage that is caused due to entry of acid from stomach into the esophagus. The esophagus is a long tube of muscle that runs from mouth to the stomach. Normally once the food is chewed, it goes from mouth to the esophagus and then into the stomach, where it is mixed with the acidic gastric juice for digestion. The esophagus and the stomach are separated by a sphincter (lower esophageal sphincter), which is a band of muscular fibers that close the valve in order to prevent the food or gastric acids from going back to the esophagus.",The most-common symptoms of GERD are:,"GERD usually manifests due to problem with the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) muscle. The LES is located at the bottom of the esophagus, the tube that runs from the back of throat to stomach.","Diagnosis of GERD is uaually accompanied with an accurate symptomatic history. It can be diagnosed by procedures like Endoscopy, Barium swallow and Manometry.",Self-care is very essential for treating GERD. It includes:
Glaucoma,What is Glaucoma?,"Primary open angle glaucoma presents as a chronic disease and usually has no symptoms in its early stages and the vision remains normal. As the optic nerve is more damaged, peripheral (side) vision is lost progressively till only the central vision is left resulting in tunnel vision (as if looking through the end of a narrow tunnel).","Glaucoma is of multifactorial etiology and raised pressure of the eye is the most important among them and the only modifiable risk factor. As already mentioned, though raised eye pressure is a risk factor, glaucoma can occur even in individuals with normal pressure. The most common abnormality of the eye leading to raised pressure of the eye is an abnormal drainage angle (angle is a structure of the eye where the fluid produced inside the eye exits). This abnormality of the angle causes obstruction to the flow of the fluid which accumulates inside the eye and causes pressure on the optic nerve leading to progressive damage and loss of vision.","The diagnosis of glaucoma is based on a review of history pertaining to the above said symptoms and risk factors, a comprehensive eye examination and several tests to support the diagnosis. Tests which are used in the diagnosis of glaucoma include – measurement of pressure of the eye using an instrument called tonometer, a look at the optic nerve head with an ophthalmoscope or stereoscopic evaluation on the slit lamp with a 90D lens, evaluation of the drainage system – anterior chamber angle of eye using an instrument called the gonioscope, testing of field of vision of each eye using an instrument known as the perimeter, measurement of thickness of cornea with a pachymeter. Specialized tests done for early detection of glaucoma and follow up include photography of the optic nerve , optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry and confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscope.","Glaucoma management aims at maintaining the vision related quality of life of the patient throughout his/her lifetime with minimal possible medications at a sustainable cost. The treatment helps to control the disease process so that further damage to the optic nerve can be prevented. There is no cure for glaucoma and treatment cannot restore visual loss but only prevent further deterioration. In the current day practice, reduction of pressure of the eye remains the only modifiable risk factor. Hence the management of glaucoma revolves around the effective control of pressure of the eye with three modalities :"
Goitre,"The term “goitre” simply refers to the abnormal enlargement of the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is a small butterfly-shaped gland in the neck, just in front of the windpipe (trachea). It produces thyroid hormones, which helps to regulate the body's metabolism (the process that turns food into energy). A swelling of thyroid gland can further lead to a swelling of the neck or larynx (voice box).","The main symptom of goitre is swelling of the thyroid gland   which causes a lump to develop in the throat. An enlarged thyroid gland can put pressure on trachea (wind pipe) and oesophagus (food tube), this can lead to breathing difficulties, cough, hoarseness of voice, difficulty in swallowing specially with solid foods.","The most common cause of goitre is Iodine deficiency. It is one of the leading causes of hypothyroidism.,Hyperthyroidism (Overactive thyroid gland): Goitre can develop if the thyroid gland becomes overactive (hyperthyroidism), leading to too much thyroid hormones being produced. Increased hormone production will over-stimulate the thyroid gland and causes it to enlarge.The leading cause of hyperthyroidism is   Graves' disease. Graves' disease causes immune system (the body’s natural defense system) to send antibodies (proteins that fight infections) to the thyroid gland. The antibodies stimulate the thyroid gland, causing an increased amount of thyroid hormones to be released.,Hyporthyroidism (Underactive thyroid gland): Goitre can also develop if the thyroid gland becomes underactive (hypothyroidism). Underactive thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones, the body will stimulate it to produce more. This can cause the thyroid gland to enlarge. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease causing hypothyroidism.",Physical examination:  Examination of  the swelling will help the physician to diagnose goitre.,The management of Goitre will depend upon whether the patient is suffering from hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.
Gonorrhea,"It is a common human sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhea. It is most common in young adults. The bacteria that cause gonorrhea can infect the genital tract, mouth, or anus. Gonorrhea generally spreads during vaginal, oral, or anal sexual encounter with an infected partner. A pregnant woman can pass it to her baby during childbirth. The usual symptoms in men are burning with urination and penile discharge. Women, on the other hand, are asymptomatic half the time or have vaginal discharge and pelvic pain. In both men and women if gonorrhea is left untreated, it may spread locally causing epididymitis or pelvic inflammatory disease or throughout the body, affecting joints and heart valves.",Men: Men who contract gonorrhoea may experience symptoms like:,"Gonorrhoea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The infection is transmitted from one person to another through vaginal, oral or anal sex. The bacteria are usually found in discharge from the penis and vaginal fluid of infected men and women. Pregnant women can spread gonorrhoea to the baby during birth. This can lead to newborn baby having an infection of the eyes (conjunctivitis), which can lead to blindness if not treated.,Reference: www.niaid.nih.gov","Gonorrhea is diagnosed with gram stain or with culture of the bacteria, however newer polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based testing methods are becoming more common.","It is important to receive treatment for gonorrhea quickly. Gonorrhea can be treated with a single dose of antibiotics, usually one of the following:"
Guillain-Barré Syndrome,"Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare disorder of the peripheral nervous system. The syndrome is named after the French physicians Georges Guillain and Jean Alexandre Barré, who described it in 1916. It is also called acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP).","Symptoms usually start with numbness or tingling in the fingers and toes. Over several days, muscle weakness develops in the legs and arms. The lower limbs are usually involved before the upper limbs. Weakness is ascending and symmetrical in nature. The weakness may progress to the arms, face (In 45%-75% of patients III-VII and IX-XII cranial nerves are involved), and muscles of respiration (the chest muscles are affected in 20%-25% of cases).",The etiology of GBS is not completely understood. It is not a contagious disorder.,"Guillain-Barré syndrome is difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are similar to other neurological disorders. Diagnosis is based on symptoms, findings on neurological examination including diminished or loss of deep-tendon reflexes.",The goal of treatment is to lessen the severity of symptoms and maintain vital functions normal while nervous system recovers.
Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis,"Giant (mechanically induced) Papillary Conjunctivitis (GPC), the severe form of mechanically induced papillary conjunctivitis, may be secondary to a variety of mechanical stimuli of the tarsal conjunctiva. Since GPC is predominantly associated with the use of contact lenses (CLs), the disease is also referred to as contact lens-induced papillary conjunctivitis (CLPC).","Many contact lens wearers consider their symptoms as normal discomfort associated with contact lens use. Symptoms may be worse after lens removal. Often, in early disease, these symptoms may be out of proportion to the clinical findings.",The antigens responsible for giant papillary conjunctivitis are not yet identified.,Diagnosis of GPC is generally made by thorough history and careful clinical observation.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Gaming Disorder,Gaming disorder is recently recommended by World Health Organisation (WHO) for inclusion in the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). ICD is used by medical practitioners around the world to diagnose conditions and by researchers to categorize conditions.,"As with any other addictions, there are emotional and physical symptoms suggestive of gaming disorder.",Various factors may be responsible for gaming disorder.,"Assessment for gaming disorder can be done by observing the different symptoms associated with video game addiction. These are significant changes in behaviour of an individual resulting into severe impairment of personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning for at least 12 months.",Integrated and comprehensive approach with consideration of co-morbid disorders and other risk factors would improve treatment outcome of such individuals.
Gum Disease,"Gum disease also known as periodontal disease is a chronic bacterial infection affecting gums and bone supporting the teeth. It may be in the form of simple gum inflammation to serious disease that can cause major harm to gums and supporting bone. Gum disease is highly prevalent and affect up to 90% of the population worldwide, and it is a major cause of tooth loss in adults. It is caused by accumulation of plaque (bacterial biofilm) which convert into calculus (tartar) along the gum line, when oral hygiene is not maintained. Gum diseases may sometimes be neglected as these are usually painless.",SIGNS & SYMPTOMS:,RISK FACTORS:,"Regular dental check-ups are required to identify gum diseases at the earliest; by looking for the signs such as bleeding or receding gums, and loose teeth. Further examinations may be necessary like x-rays, to find out how much of the bone, if any, has been lost.",
Hepatitis,"Hepatitis is a term used to describe inflammation (swelling) of the liver. It can be caused due to viral infection or when liver is exposed to harmful substances such as alcohol. Hepatitis may occur with limited or no symptoms, but often leads to jaundice, anorexia (poor appetite) and malaise. Hepatitis is of 2 types: acute and chronic.",Initial symptoms of hepatitis caused by infection are similar to the flu and include:,"Hepatitis infection is caused by Hepatitis viruses: Type A, B, C, D, E",Diagnosis of hepatitis is made by biochemical assessment of liver function.,"Bed rest, refraining from alcohol, and taking medication to relieve symptoms.,Most people who have hepatitis A and E get well on their own after a few weeks.,Hepatitis B is treated with drugs, such as lamivudine and adefovir dipivoxil.,Hepatitis C is treated with a combination of peginterferon and ribovarin.,Liver transplant of hepatitis B or C, or D-caused liver failure"
Herpes Simplex,"Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), are two members of the herpes virus family.",In children:,"Herpes simplex is generally caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 (HSV-1,2).",The primary method of testing for the virus is:,"There is no way to eradicate herpes virus from the body, but antiviral medications can reduce the frequency, duration, and severity of outbreaks."
Haemophilia,Haemophilia is an inherited condition that affects the blood’s ability to clot.,The severity of the condition is determined by the level of clotting factors in the blood:,"Genetics: The genes are responsible for clotting factors VIII and IX are on the (X) chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes (XX) and males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (XY). If a female inherits an X chromosome with ‘haemophilia’ clotting factor genes, the other X chromosome will usually be normal, so they are still able to produce safe levels of clotting factors. Although some female ‘carriers’ of the ‘haemophilia’ X chromosome do have occasional clotting problems, they are rarely as serious as the problems in males. If a male inherits a ‘haemophilia’ X chromosome and they will not be able to produce normal levels of the clotting factors they need. Most males who inherit the ‘haemophilia’ X chromosome will have clotting problems some will be extremely severe.","Several options are available to diagnose hemophilia before, during and after birth if there is a family history of the condition.","As such there is no cure for haemophilia, it can be managed with regular infusions of the deficient clotting factor, i.e. factor VIII in hemophilia A or factor IX in haemophilia B. Factor replacement can either be isolated from human blood serum or a combination of the two. Some haemophiliacs develop antibodies (inhibitors) against the replacement factors given to them, so the amount of the factor has to be increased or non-human replacement products must be given, such as porcine factor VIII."
Hemangioma,A haemangioma is a benign tumour of the endothelial cells that line blood vessels and is characterized by increased number of normal or abnormal vessels filled with blood.,"A red to reddish-purple, raised sore (lesion) on the skin,A massive, raised tumour with blood vessels.",The exact cause of haemangioma is currently unknown. It consists of an abnormally dense group of extra blood vessels. The haemangioma may be:,A haemangioma is usually diagnosed based on its appearance. Diagnostic tests aren't usually needed.,"Laser surgery: Laser surgery is generally performed to stop the growth of a haemangioma. Sometimes lasers can be used to remove a haemangioma or treat sores on a haemangioma that won't heal. The risks include pain, infection, bleeding, scarring and changes in skin colour."
Horner Syndrome,"Horner syndrome (oculosympathetic palsy) is characterised by the classical triad of miosis (small and constricted pupil), partial ptosis (drooping of upper eyelid) and anhidrosis (loss of hemi facial sweating) caused due to disruption of sympathetic pathways. Von Passow syndrome is an association of Horner syndrome with heterochromia iridis (different colour in parts of same iris).",Disruption of sympathetic pathway due to a lesion may lead to:,"Horner syndrome may be hereditary (autosomal dominant), congenital or acquired. Lesions may be central (involves hypothalamus or spinal cord) or peripheral (involves cervical sympathetic chain).",Presenting features depends upon the underlying cause.,Many cases of Horner syndrome do not have effective treatment.
Hypertensive Retinopathy,"Hypertension or raised blood pressure is usually considered when the reading exceeds 140mm of Hg (systolic) and 90mm of Hg (diastolic). It is recorded as 140/90mm of Hg. Treatment at this level depends upon risk of coronary events, presence of diabetes or end organ damage. All patients with malignant hypertension or a sustained blood pressure more than 160/100mm of Hg should be treated. Malignant hypertension refers to severe hypertension ( more than 200mm of Hg as systolic and more than 130mm of Hg as diastolic) in conjunction with bilateral retinal haemorrhages and exudates with or without papilloedema.",Most of the patients do not show any symptoms.,Chronic hypertension leads to arteriosclerotic changes in the blood vessels.,Diagnosis of hypertensive retinopathy is based on presence of systemic hypertension and examination of retina (by an eye specialist) after dilating the pupil.,Systemic hypertension should be controlled as a primary measure for Hypertensive retinopathy.
Helminthiasis (Soil-Transmitted Helminth Infections),A soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infection is a sub-group within the group of helminth infections. It is caused specifically by those helminthes (worms) which are transmitted through soil contaminated with faecal matter and are therefore called soil-transmitted helminth (Intestinal parasitic worms) infections.,People with light infections usually have no symptoms.,"The main species that infect people are the roundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides), the whipworm (Trichuris trichiura) and hookworms (Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale).",STH can be diagnosed by examination of stool sample using Microscope for the presence of eggs.,Anthelminthic medications (drugs that expel parasitic worms) are used for the treatment of helminthiasis.
Hypertension (High Blood Pressure),Hypertension,Most hypertensive people have no symptoms at all; this is why it is known as the “silent killer”.,Hypertension is divided into primary (essential) and secondary hypertension.,"All adults should know their blood pressure levels. There are different types of devices (sphygmomanometers) that are used to measure blood pressure. These are electronic, mercury and aneroid devices.","All adults should have their blood pressure checked routinely, if blood pressure is high, they need the advice of a health worker."
Human Papillomavirus (Hpv) Infection And Cervical Cancer,Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a group of viruses that is common throughout the world. HPV is one of the causative agents in the sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in men and women with and without clinical lesions a. HPV is transmitted through sexual contact and is the most common viral infection of the reproductive tract.,Most of the HPV infections cause no symptoms and subsides spontaneously by body’s immune system. More than 90% of infections are cleared within two years.,"HPV is a member of the family Papillomaviridae. They are small, non-enveloped deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viruses. They are classified according to DNA sequencing. There are more than 100 types of HPV, of which at least 13 are cancer-causing (also known as high risk type) including genotypes 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59 and 66. The types of HPV that cause genital warts are different from the types that can cause cancer.",Most of the HPV infections and cervical cancer in its early stage show no clinical signs and symptoms; precancerous lesions and early cancers can be detected by screening tests. Screening is recommended for every woman from aged 30 to 49 years at least once in a lifetime and ideally more frequently (WHO).,"If abnormal cells or lesions detected during screening tests, treatment is needed to excise abnormal cells or lesions. It includes cryotherapy (destroying abnormal tissue on the cervix by freezing it) or Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) when the patient is not eligible for cryotherapy."
Heat-Related Illnesses And Heat Waves,Heat- Related Illnesses are the various manifestations of extreme heat and are increasing with increased global warming and heat waves. Periods of extreme heat that have an effect on human health are referred as heat waves. Climate change is leading to an increase in average temperatures and increased possibilities of severe heat waves. The impact of extreme summer heat on human health may be exacerbated by increase in humidity. Heat waves are an emerging public-health problem.,symptoms of various heat related illnesses are-,"As the body temperature increases, the body tries to maintain its normal temperature by transferring heat. Sweating and blood flow to the skin (Thermoregulation) help to keep body cool. A heat-related illness occurs when the body cannot transfer enough heat to keep the body cool. A high body temperature (hyperthermia) can develop rapidly in extremely hot environments.",In most cases diagnosis is made clinically. This involves taking the temperature and assessing the symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke.,Heat rash-
"Hand, Foot And Mouth Disease","Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a communicable disease mostly affects infants and children but can also occur in adolescents and adults. It is an acute viral infection caused by a group of enteroviruses, including Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) and Enterovirus 71 (EV71). The disease is usually mild characterized by fever, painful sores in the mouth, and a rash with blisters on hands, feet and also buttocks. Infection with EV71 can cause severe disease in children, sometimes resulting in death.",HFMD is usually a mild disease. Symptoms may appear in 3-7 days after getting infection (this period is termed as incubation period).,"HFMD is caused by group of viruses called enteroviruses. There are different types of viruses in this group that include polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses and other enteroviruses. The common viruses causing HFMD are coxsackievirus A16 resulting in mild self limiting disease with few complications and enterovirus 71 (EV71) which has been associated with serious complication and is fatal.","The diagnosis of HFMD is based on clinical examination. Samples for virology investigation from the throat swabs, vesicles, rectal swab/ stool or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may be collected and sent to a laboratory to test for the virus.","In most cases, HFMD is a self-limiting illness, with the majority of children recovering spontaneously with symptomatic treatment as:"
Hypermetropia,"Hypermetropia (hyperopia, long-sightedness or far- sightedness) is a form of refractive error in which parallel rays of light coming from infinity are focused behind the light sensitive layer of the retina, when the eye is at rest.","The symptoms vary depending upon the age of the patient and the severity of refractive error. Patient may be asymptomatic. Small amount of refractive error in young patients is usually corrected by mild accommodative effort, without producing any symptoms.",Hypermetropia may be:,Diagnosis of hypermetropia is based on the symptoms and clinical signs observed.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Heterophoria,"Heterophoria or latent squint is defined as a condition in which eyes in the primary position or in their movement are maintained on the fixation point under stress only, with the aid of corrective fusion reflexes. When the influence of fusion is removed, the visual axis of one eye deviates.","Depending upon the symptoms, heterophoria may be divided into compensated and de-compensated types.",Causes of heterophoria are grouped as,There are different methods for diagnosis of heterophorias. There is no reason to believe that heterophorias are of smaller magnitude as compared to heterotropia. Heterophoria may be as large as 25˚ and heterotropia may be as small as 5˚ (microtropia). Nature of deviation depends upon the degree of fusion amplitude.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Hypervitaminosis A,"Hypervitaminosis A usually results from chronic and excessive intake, generally for weeks or months together, of preformed vitamin A (as retinol or its esterified form). Excessive use of food supplements containing vitamin A, or food fads of intake of organ meat may be the cause. Toxicity is produced with chronic intake of 6000μg of vitamin A in children, and 15000μg of vitamin A in adults.",Patient may present with symptoms such as,"Hypervitaminosis A is usually caused by chronic and excessive intake, generally for weeks or months together, of preformed vitamin A (as retinol or its estrified form). Excessive use of food supplements containing vitamin A, or food fads of intake of organ meat may be the cause.","Besides clinical symptoms, patient may have clinical signs such as",There is no antidote for hypervitaminosis A.
High Risk Pregnancy,"Pregnancy (gestation) is the physiological process of a developing fetus within the maternal body. The term high risk pregnancy is used by health care providers to demarcate a pregnancy in which a mother, her foetus or both are at higher risk of developing complications during pregnancy or child birth than in a normal pregnancy. Women with high-risk pregnancies should receive care from a special team of health care providers to ensure the best possible outcomes.",If some conditions are associated with pregnancy than it is listed as high risk pregnancy* such as,"Though any pregnancy could develop complications during or after pregnancy and child birth, but a pregnancy with high risk factor poses higher than normal risk for the pregnant women and fetus.",During antenatal visits following  points are important during examination :,"Management of high-risk pregnancy depends on the woman’s specific risk factors. In a high-risk pregnancy, healthcare providers keep a close watch on the woman and the pregnancy to detect any potential problems as quickly as possible so that treatment can start before the woman’s or fetus’s health is in danger."
Ichthyosis,"Ichthyosis is a generalized, mostly genetic disorder of the skin. All types of ichthyosis have dry, thickened, scaly or flaky skin. There is no cure, but symptoms are usually mild and manageable with a daily skin care routine. The severity of symptoms can vary extremely, from the mildest types such as ichthyosis vulgaris which may be mistaken for normal dry skin up to life-threatening conditions such as harlequin type ichthyosis. The most common type of ichthyosis is ichthyosis vulgaris, accounting for more than 95% of cases.",The symptoms specific to each type of inherited ichthyosis are given below:,Inherited Ichthyosis is caused by mutations in genes passed on to the child by both parents. Parents carrying genes may not manifest condition. Mutations may also affect gametes (sperm or ovum) or zygote (product of conception).,Ichthyosis is generally diagnosed by physical examination of the skin. Sometimes a family history is also very useful. A skin biopsy is also done at times to help to confirm the diagnosis.,"Doctor may prescribe moisturizers. Creams and ointments work better than lotions.These creams should be applied to moist skin immediately after bathing. One should use mild, non-drying soaps."
Inflammatory Bowel Disease,Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of inflammatory conditions of the colon and small intestine. The major types of IBD are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis .,The main symptoms of Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are similar.,The exact causes of Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are not clear.,Following tests and procedures are used to diagnosis:,One should eat well balanced and healthy food.
Insomnia,"Insomnia or sleeplessness, is a disorder characterized by an inability to fall asleep or to stay asleep for a desired duration. Insomnia is generally seen as both a sign and a symptom that can accompany several sleep, medical, and psychiatric disorders characterized by a persistent difficulty falling asleep. Insomnia is typically followed by functional impairment while awake. Insomnia can occur at any age, but it is particularly common in the elderly.","Waking up early in the morning and not being able to get back to sleep,Waking up several times in the middle of night,Lying awake for a long time at night,Feeling tired and not refreshed by sleep,Being irritable","Stressful events: If somebody experiences insomnia due to any stressful event. Like worrying about work, money or health, a loved one becoming ill or dying, and even noise and light are all causes of Stress and are likely to keep you awake at night.",Sleep history: Doctor may ask the patient about his sleep history.,Cognitive and behavioural treatments: Cognitive behavioural treatments (CBT) aim to change unhelpful thoughts and behaviours that may be contributing to insomnia. CBT is usually recommended if someone had sleep problems for more than four weeks.
Iron Deficiency Anemia,Iron is very important ingredient of human diet. This is essential for formation of haemoglobin   Low levels of Haemoglobin causes Iron deficiency anaemia. The red cells contain haemoglobin. The red cells are important particles in blood.,The most common symptoms include:,It can be due to:,To diagnosis Iron deficiency anemia blood test is performed to check the levels of:,"An iron supplement to restore iron deficiency in the body. The most commonly prescribed supplement is ferrous sulphate, taken orally (by mouth) two or three times a day. Iron-rich foods include:"
Infertility,Infertility is “a disease of the reproductive system defined by the failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse (WHO-ICMART glossary*). There are two kinds of infertility - primary and secondary:,"For a woman, infertility (or a state of subfertility) can manifest itself as either (WHO):",Infertility can be caused by both men and women factors. About a third of infertility problems are due to female infertility and another third are due to male infertility. In remaining cases infertility may be due to problems in both partners or the cause is unclear.,"Both male and female factors can contribute to infertility. A detailed medical history, physical examination and investigations are needed to assess the cause of infertility.",Management of infertility ranges from counseling and advice to medications and surgery.
Intrauterine Growth Restriction (Iugr),"Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a common complication of pregnancy in developing countries, and carries an increased risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity. IUGR refers to a condition in which foetus (an unborn baby) is smaller or less developed than normal for the baby's gender and gestational age. Gestational age is the age of a foetus or baby that starts on the first day of the mother's last menstrual period.","The main symptom of IUGR is a small for gestational age baby. During the antenatal checkup, a doctor measures the height of the uterus from the pubic bone to estimate the size of the fetus. After about the 20th week, uterine fundal height in centimeters is usually equal to the number of weeks of the pregnancy. A lag in fundal height of 4 cm or more with weeks of pregnancy suggests IUGR, and additional tests are required to confirm diagnosis.","IUGR has many causes related to mother, foetus and placenta (part that joins the mother and foetus). Various risk factors for IUGR can be summarized as-",One of the most important things when diagnosing IUGR is to know accurate gestational age of baby. Gestational age can be calculated by using the first day of last menstrual period (LMP) and also by early ultrasound calculations. Once the gestational age is known the following methods can be used to diagnose IUGR.,"General management measures: These include treatment of maternal disease, good nutrition and advice for bed rest."
Japanese Encephalitis,Japanese encephalitis(JE) is a viral disease that infects animals and humans. It is transmitted by mosquitoes in humans causing inflammation of the membranes around the brain. Japanese encephalitis is a leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia generally spread from western pacific region in east to Pakistan in west and from Korea in north to Papua New Guinea in south.,Japanese encephalitis has an incubation period of 5 to 15 days and the majority of infections are asymptomatic i.e. only 1 in 250 infections develop into encephalitis.,Japanese encephalitis is caused by a flavi virus. This type of virus can affect both animals and humans. The virus is passed on to humans from animals through an infected mosquito.,Blood tests: To know the antibodies present in the blood.,"There is no specific treatment for Japanese encephalitis, supportive treatment is provided. Measures can be taken to control symptoms and prevent complications from developing."
Jaundice,Jaundice is a term used to describe the yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes. It's caused by a build-up of a substance called bilirubin in the blood and body's tissues. Any condition that disrupts the movement of bilirubin from the blood to the liver and out of the body can cause jaundice. Bilirubin is a yellow pigment that is formed by the breakdown of dead red blood cells (RBC) in the liver. There are several ways that a build- up of bilirubin can occur:,The main symptoms of jaundice are:,"Jaundice is classified into three categories, depending on which part of the physiological mechanism the pathology affects. The three categories are:",Urine test: It is used to measure levels of a substance called urobilinogen. Urobilinogen is produced when bacteria break down bilirubin inside the digestive system.,"There's no treatment for jaundice as such, but disease can be managed by managing symptoms and causes of jaundice.,Pre-hepatic jaundice,In treating pre-hepatic jaundice, the objective is to prevent the rapid breakdown of red blood cells that's causing the level of bilirubin to build up in the blood.,In cases of infections, such as malaria, the use of medication to treat the underlying infection is usually recommended. For genetic blood disorders, such as sickle cell anemia or thalassemia, blood transfusions may be required to replace the red blood cells.,Gilbert's syndrome doesn't usually require treatment because the jaundice associated with the condition isn't particularly serious and doesn't pose a serious threat to health."
Kala-Azar/ Leishmaniasis,"Kala-Azar is a slow progressing indigenous disease caused by a protozoan parasite of the genus Leishmania. In India Leishmania donovani is the only parasite that causes this disease. The parasite primarily infects the reticulo-endothelial system and may be found in abundance in bone marrow, spleen and liver.",Recurrent fever intermittent or remittent with often double rise of temperature.,"There is only one sand fly vector of Kala-Azar in India i.e. Phlebotomus argentipes. Sand flies are small insects, about one fourth of the size of a mosquito. The length of a sand fly body ranges from 1.5 to 3.5 mm.","Symptomatic:,A case of fever of more than two weeks duration not responding to anti-malarials and antibiotics. Clinical laboratory findings may include anemia, progressive leucopenia thrombocytopenia and hypergammaglobulinemia.","Diagnosis and treatment of Kala-Azar are problematic because of a variety of reasons. While treatment is lengthy and relatively costly, definitive diagnosis of Kala-Azar requires tissue specimens, which are conventionally obtained by organ needle aspiration for microscopic demonstration of amastigote forms in stained smears. Bone marrow the spleen, and lymph-node (in some regions) are the tissues most often sampled in patients with suspected infection. The diagnostic sensitivity of splenic aspiration is high (95% - 98%), but the procedure carries a risk of bleeding; the sensitivity of examination of bone marrow specimens is considered to be lower (53% - 95%). Organ aspiration and accurate examination of smears also require technical skills that are not uniformly available in rural areas. Culture or PCR testing of aspirate material improves parasitologic yield, but these methods are seldom undertaken outside of research laboratories."
Kaposi’S Sarcoma,Kaposi’s Sarcoma (KS) is a type of cancer that can affect both the skin and internal organs. It is generally caused by human herpes 8. The most common symptom of Kaposi’s Sarcoma is the appearance of red or purple patches on the skin. The patches then grow into lumps known as nodules. Kaposi’s Sarcoma is a systemic disease that can present with cutaneous lesions with or without internal involvement.,"They are typically found on the skin, but can also spread elsewhere, especially the mouth, gastro-intestinal tract and respiratory tract.","Kaposi’s sarcoma is caused by a virus called the human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8), which is also known as the Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV).The virus is transmitted during sex, through saliva, or from a mother to her baby during birth. HHV-8 doesn't cause Kaposi’s sarcoma in everyone who gets infected with the virus.",HIV tests: Blood test for diagnosis of HIV.,The treatment of Kaposi’s sarcoma will depend on:
Keratosis Pilaris,"It is also known as 'Chicken skin', 'lichen pilaris' or 'follicular keratosis'. Keratosis pilaris is a type of skin condition in which skin protein called keratin forms hard plugs within hair follicles. It is autosomal genetic disease characterized by appearance of rough, slightly red, bumps on the skin. It most often appears on the back and outer sides of the arm (though the forearm can also be affected), and can also occur on the thighs, hands, and tops of legs, sides, buttocks, or any body part except glabrous skin (like the palms or soles of feet). It is generally seen in patients with dry skin. The condition often worsens during winters.,References: www.nhs.uk,www.nlm.nih.gov","The patches of affected skin will be in the form of tiny spiky bumps, it may be skin-coloured, red or brown. This spotting will give the appearance of 'chicken skin' or permanent goose pimples, and the skin feels rough, like sandpaper. In some people, the skin will itch and there may be slight redness around the bumps. The condition is not contagious.",The exact cause is still not known. But it has been observed that it runs in some families.,It is generally diagnosed by examining the skin.,Treatment is still not known but symptoms can be managed:
Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca (Dry Eye Syndrome),"Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca (KCS) or Dry eye syndrome is mainly caused due to aqueous tear deficiency.,As per Dry Eye Workshop (DEWS) 2007,  KCS is defined as ‘a multifactorial disease of the tear film and ocular surface that results in symptoms of discomfort, visual disturbance, and tears film instability with potential damage to the ocular surface. It is accompanied by increased osmolality of tear film and inflammation of the ocular surface’.,Tear film has three components:-,Outer lipid layer: It is outer oily layer which retards evaporation of aqueous tears. It lubricates eyelids and prevents spillover of tears over lid margin.,Middle aqueous layer: It supply oxygen to cornea (transparent layer covering front of eye ) and make surface smooth by filling minute irregularities. It prevents bacterial infection and also washes away debris.,Inner mucin layer: It makes cornea wettable by aqueous in middle layer.,A defect in any component of tear film may lead to dry eye syndrome but primarily it is from aqueous tear deficiency.,Tears have smaller basic (resting) and larger reflex component. Reflex secretion occurs due to corneal sensory stimulation.,Effective spread and resurfacing, in addition to normal tear film, requires:-,Normal smooth corneal surface.,Normal rate of blinking.,Congruent ocular surface and eyelid.,References:,http://emedicine.medscape.com,2007 Report of the international Dry Eye WorkShop.

Bell’s palsy.,Dry eyes associated with contact lens wear.,Environmental factors like exposure to heating, air conditioning, increased velocity of air or reduced humidity.","Dry eye should be distinguished from other diseases affecting anterior surface of the eye e.g. conjunctivitis, infectious diseases, corneal abnormalities or keratopathies. Diagnosis depends upon clinical examination of eyes and conduct of certain specialised tests.","Aim is to provide symptomatic relief to patient. A smooth corneal surface prevents its further   damage and aggravation of symptoms.,Various modalities may be :,Avoiding high room temperature to decrease evaporation of existing tears.,Use of room humidifiers or moist chamber spectacles to reduce evaporation.,Contact lenses may be used to protect eyes. These may be of silicone rubber or gas permeable scleral bearing hard contact lenses with or without fenestration or highly gas permeable for overnight wear.,Lubricating supplements are the medications most commonly used.  Artificial tears are used for mild to moderate KCS. These have short duration of action and therefore requires frequent instillation.,Artificial tears may be of following types :,Cellulose derivatives.,Mucomimetics.,Polyvinyl alcohol .,Other tear substitutes :,Povidone and sodium chloride.,Sodium hyaluronate to promote epithelial healing.,Mineral oil ointment may be used at night time before sleep.,Mucolytic drops e.g. acetylcysteine may be used for corneal filaments and mucous plaques.,Anti-inflammatory agents like topical corticosteroids, topical cyclosporine or topical or systemic omega-3 fatty acids (omega-3 fatty acids inhibit the synthesis of lipid mediators) may be used.,Use of topical or systemic tetracycline.,Use of autologous or umbilical cord serum. Serum eye drops are used in cases of severe KCS with punctate epithelial defects and corneal damage to promote reepithelisation.,Use of systemic immunosuppressants.,Patients with lagophthalmos (incomplete lid closure) may be benefitted with small lateral tarsorrhahy (stitching together of upper and lower lid) to preserve tears.,Occlusion of punctum (punctum is a small  hole in lids for drainage of tears from eyes to nose)  is useful in severe KCS and also in those showing drug toxicity.,Occlusion of punctum may be :,Temporary: Punctum may be blocked with plug, silicone rods or even with 2/0 catgut suture. Plugs may be absorbable,nonabsorbable,hydrogel or thermoplastic. Initially, all four puncta are blocked. This is to assess whether blockage leads to tearing or not. Based on the results, permanent occlusion may be planned,Permanent: This is undertaken for severe KCS with Schirmer’s test value consistently being 2mm or less. It is done with gentle heating of proximal canaliculus ( small passage connecting punctum to the lacrimal sac) with cautery at black heat or by Argon laser. Permanent occlusion should be avoided in young patients due to fluctuating tear amount.,Conjunctival flap may be pulled over to prevent dryness and its complications.,Mucous membrane grafting.,Amniotic membrane transplantation may be done.,Salivary gland duct transposition for lubrication.,Descemetocele (thin and bulging cornea), impending or frank perforation may be covered with tissue adhesive cyanoacrylate, corneal or corneoscleral patch."
Kyasanur Forest Disease,"Kyasanur forest disease (KFD) is a tick-borne viral haemorrhagic fever endemic (constant presence of disease) in Karnataka State, India. It is also referred as monkey fever by local people. The virus causing the disease: KFD virus (KFDV) is a member of the genus Flavivirus and family Flaviviridae.",The incubation period of KFD is about 2 to 7 days after tick bites or exposure.,KFD is caused by a virus of flavivirus group called KFDV. It is antigenically related to other tick-borne flaviviruses and resembling Russian spring–summer (RSS) complex of viruses.,"The disease should be differentiated from other diseases such as influenza, typhoid, dengue, malaria, leptospirosis, rickettsial group of fevers. The following tests should be performed on blood samples:",There is no specific treatment for KFD.
Keratoconus,"Keratoconus is a non-inflammatory, bilateral (but usually asymmetrical) disease of the cornea which results in progressive corneal steepening. It is characterised by para-central corneal thinning and ectasia so that the cornea takes the shape of a cone. Visual loss occurs primarily from myopia and irregular astigmatism and secondarily from corneal scarring.","Symptoms are highly variable and depend upon the stage of the disease. Early in the disease, there may be no symptoms. In advanced disease, there is significant diminution and distortion of vision.","The cause of keratoconus is not known. It may not be a single disorder, but rather a phenotypic expression of perhaps many causes, both genetic and environmental.","Refraction, keratometry, corneal topography and slit- lamp (bio-microscopy) examination helps in reaching to the diagnosis of keratoconus.",Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Keratoglobus,"Keratoglobus is a rare non-inflammatory corneal thinning disorder characterised by generalised thinning and globular ectasis (protrusion) of the cornea. The non-inflammatory corneal ectasias are a group of disorders characterised by corneal thinning, protrusion, and scarring. Keratoglobus forms a rarer subset of this group.",Patients are generally asymptomatic.,Causes of Keratoglobus may be:,"The diagnosis of keratoglobus is essentially clinical, owing to the characteristic clinical findings. In less severe cases, there may be difficulty in differentiating the condition from other ectatic conditions.",Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Leishmaniasis/ Kala-Azar,"Kala-Azar is a slow progressing indigenous disease caused by a protozoan parasite of the genus Leishmania. In India Leishmania donovani is the only parasite that causes this disease. The parasite primarily infects the reticulo-endothelial system and may be found in abundance in bone marrow, spleen and liver.",Recurrent fever intermittent or remittent with often double rise of temperature.,"There is only one sand fly vector of Kala-Azar in India i.e. Phlebotomus argentipes. Sand flies are small insects, about one fourth of the size of a mosquito. The length of a sand fly body ranges from 1.5 to 3.5 mm.","Symptomatic:,A case of fever of more than two weeks duration not responding to anti-malarials and antibiotics. Clinical laboratory findings may include anemia, progressive leucopenia thrombocytopenia and hypergammaglobulinemia.","Diagnosis and treatment of Kala-Azar are problematic because of a variety of reasons. While treatment is lengthy and relatively costly, definitive diagnosis of Kala-Azar requires tissue specimens, which are conventionally obtained by organ needle aspiration for microscopic demonstration of amastigote forms in stained smears. Bone marrow the spleen, and lymph-node (in some regions) are the tissues most often sampled in patients with suspected infection. The diagnostic sensitivity of splenic aspiration is high (95% - 98%), but the procedure carries a risk of bleeding; the sensitivity of examination of bone marrow specimens is considered to be lower (53% - 95%). Organ aspiration and accurate examination of smears also require technical skills that are not uniformly available in rural areas. Culture or PCR testing of aspirate material improves parasitologic yield, but these methods are seldom undertaken outside of research laboratories."
Lichen Planus,"Lichen planus is an inflammatory skin disorder. The disease presents itself in the form of papules, lesions or rashes. Lichen planus is a non-infectious, itchy rash that can affect many areas of the body.",The symptoms of lichen planus vary according to area of the body are affected. The most common symptoms are seen in,"The exact reason for Lichen planus is still unknown. However, it is related to either the immune system (the body's natural defense against infection and illness) or an allergic reaction to certain medicines.",It is often diagnosed through physical examination.,Medicines used to treat lichen planus include:
Leprosy,"Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease (HD), is a chronic infectious disease caused by a Mycobacterium (Mycobacterium leprae) affecting especially the skin and marginal nerves. It is characterized by the formation of nodules or macules that enlarge and spread with loss of sensation and eventually paralysis, wasting of muscle, and production of deformities called also Hansen's disease. This infection is caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis. It is primarily a granulomatous disease of the peripheral nerves and mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, skin lesions are the primary external sign. If left untreated, leprosy can be progressive, causing permanent damage to the skin, nerves, limbs and eyes.",The disease has following symptoms:,Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis are the causative agents of leprosy. Mycobacterium can spread from person to person. This might happen when someone with the disease coughs or sneezes. This can release droplets into the air. It might also happen if somebody is exposed to other nasal fluids (also known as secretions) that might be contaminated with the bacteria.,Leprosy is diagnosed by finding at least one of the following cardinal signs (WHO):,The multidrug therapy (MDT) is an effective and a powerful tool in curing leprosy. Adherence to treatment and its successful completion are equally important for the cure.
Leptospirosis,"It is an infectious disease caused by bacteria of the genus Leptospira and affects both humans as well as other animals.,Leptospirosis is one of the world's most widespread diseases transmitted by animals to humans. The infection is generally transmitted to humans by water that has been contaminated by animal urine which comes in contact with unhealed breaks in the skin, the eyes, or with the mucous membranes.,In most of the cases, leptospirosis only causes mild flu-like symptoms, such as headache, chills and muscle pain. However, in some cases the infection is more severe and can cause life-threatening problems, including organ failure and internal bleeding. Severe form of leptospirosis is known as Weil's disease.","Mild symptoms, includes:","Leptospirosis iscaused by bacteria called leptospira, which is found in urine of infected   animals and infection can spread from animals to humans. Rodents, Cattle, buffaloes, horses, sheep, goat, pigs and dogs are considered common reservoirs of the bacteria that cause leptospirosis.,The incubation period of leptospirosis is usually 5–14 days, with a range of 2–30 days.,Outbreaks of leptospirosis can occur, due to close contact with infected freshwater sources, such as some water sports. It is also possible for people to become infected after a natural disaster, such as a flood.",Blood test is done to detect antibodies for the bacteria.,Leptospirosis can be treated with medicines like:
Leukemia,"Leukemia is group of blood cancers of white cells. The generation of white cells increases in bone marrow (a hollow space in bones), where most blood particles are formed.  The increased numbers of abnormal white cells are immature and are called “Blasts”.",Symptoms of acute leukemia include:,Acute leukemia begins with an alteration to the structure of DNA found in the stem cells responsible for producing white blood cells. This is known as a genetic mutation.,Microscopic Examination: The blood count will show an abnormally high number of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).,Treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia is carried out in stages:
Lymphoedema,"It is also known as Lymphatic Obstruction, is a condition of localized fluid retention and tissue swelling caused by a compromised lymphatic system. The lymphatic system returns the interstitial fluid to the thoracic duct and then to the bloodstream, where it is re circulated back to the tissues.",The main symptom of lymphoedema is swelling in all or part of a limb.,"There are two types of Lymphoedema- Primary and Secondary lymphoedema, which have different causes.",Measuring limb volume- These tests are explained below:,The recommended treatment for lymphoedema is a treatment plan called Complex Decongestive Therapy (CDT). It is also known as Decongestive Lymphatic Therapy (DLT).
Ligneous Conjunctivitis,"Ligneous conjunctivitis (LC) is a rare, potentially sight and even life-threatening (e.g. by airway obstruction) disorder characterised by recurrent, often bilateral fibrin-rich pseudo-membranous lesions of wood-like consistency that develop mainly on the tarsal conjunctiva. It is the main clinical manifestation of systemic plasminogen deficiency and typically presents in childhood. There appears to be a higher incidence in females as compared to males. With plasminogen deficiency, wound-healing capability is diminished and is most pronounced in mucous membranes, such as conjunctiva.  Plasminogen is converted to plasmin by plasminogen activators in the blood. Plasmin is a serine protease and is the predominant fibrinolytic enzyme in the human circulation, and is also found in the extracellular matrix. Plasmin plays an important role in haemostasis, as well as, is an integral component of wound healing (acts by degrading fibrin). Due to plasminogen deficiency, fibrin rich membranes or mucous strands accumulate, which on desiccation of the fibrin leads to the ligneous consistency of the conjunctival lesions. Episodes may be triggered by relatively minor trauma, surgery (done particularly for pterygium or pinguecula) or by systemic events such as fever and anti-fibrinolytic therapy. Similar mechanisms occur in extra-ocular manifestations of plasminogen deficiency.",Patients typically present with chronic conjunctivitis and LC is bilateral in about half of the cases. Duration of disease varies from few months to many years.,There is evidence to support that ligneous conjunctivitis is the result of plasminogen deficiency.,"The diagnosis of LC is based on the clinical picture (ocular and/or extra-ocular membranous lesions), the typical histological findings, and a possible positive family history. In most patients with LC, hypo-plasminogenaemia may be found.",Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Low Vision And Visuai Aids,"Vision is the special sense by which the qualities of an object (as colour, luminosity, shape, and size) constituting its appearance are perceived through a process in which light rays entering the eye are transformed by the retina(light sensitive inner layer of eyeball) into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve .,Visual acuity is a measure of resolution of the visual processing system. It is measured commonly with an eye chart e.g. Snellen chart.  A common Snellen chart is printed with eleven lines of block letters. In visual acuity testing on Snellen chart, person normally sits at a distance of 6 meters from the chart on which letters of standard decreasing size are there in rows. Top line has a single letter which should be readable at a distance of 60 meters. Visual acuity is recorded as a ratio with numerator of 6 (distance at which patient sits.) and the denominator of the smallest possible size being read by the patient. For example, a vision record of 6/60 means that patient sitting at 6 meters could read letter in top line only , which should normally be read at 60 meters. Instead of distances being in meters, it may also be measured in feet. 6 meters is about 20 feet. Therefore, a vision of 6/6 in meters, is equivalent to a vision of 20/20 in feet. Similarly, a vision of 6/60 in meters, is equal to 20/200 in feet.,Typical Snellen chart to estimate visual acuity: Image in Wikipedia(link is external),Low vision was defined as ‘Visual acuity of 6/18 down to and including 3/60 in the better eye’. A person with low vision is ‘someone who, after medical, surgical and/or optical intervention, has a corrected visual acuity in the better eye of   <6/18 down to and including light perception or a central visual field of   <20 degrees, but who uses or has the potential to use vision for the planning and/or execution of a task.’ Thus, Low vision is a reduced level of vision that cannot be fully corrected with conventional glasses. In 10th revision of the International classification of the diseases (ICD-10 version: 2015), the term low vision is replaced by terms ‘moderate visual impairment(presenting visual acuity of   <6/18 to 6/60)’ and ‘severe visual impairment (presenting visual acuity of   <6/60 to 3/60)’, from all causes.,‘ Vision 2020: the Right  to Sight’ is a partnership between World Health Organisation (WHO) and the International Agency for the prevention of Blindness(IAPB), had been launched in 1999 with the twin aims of eliminating avoidable blindness by the year 2020 and preventing the projected doubling of avoidable visual impairment between 1990 and 2020 . VISION 2020 advocates for increased awareness of the need for low vision services. Low vision services are aimed at people who have residual vision that can be used and enhanced by specific aids. A low vision resource centre is operating from Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region, China, to distribute high quality, affordable low vision devices and equipment to all regions.,References:,http://www.who.int/blindness/Vision2020_report.pdf(link is external),www.aoa.org(link is external),www.kellogg.umich.edu(link is external),www.eschenbach.com(link is external),www.visionaware.org(link is external),www.geteyesmart.com(link is external),Abrams David.

Though treated surgically, few associated with ocular diseases may benefit with Low vision aids.,Diabetic Retinopathy  -  In Diabetes, due to hypoxia ( less oxygen supply to retina ), there are vascular changes leading to haemorrhages (bleeding) and exudates ( leaks from vessel ). These changes in Macula may produce diminution of vision.,Glaucoma – In Glaucoma, there is rise in intraocular pressure leading to damage to the optic nerve and diminution of vision.,Retinal Detachment – Retina may separate from its underlying layer and leads to diminution of vision.,Retinitis Pigmentosa -   An inherited disease, usually affects peripheral vision to begin with, leads to night blindness.,Retinopathy of Prematurity –Retinal vessels are not fully developed in premature infants. Premature infants are kept on oxygen in incubator. There is relative hypoxia in peripheral part of retina, which leads to new vessel formation and other complications, leading to diminution of vision.,Optic Nerve Diseases like Optic Atrophy,Heredomacular degeneration (Stargardt’s disease),Albinism,Nystagmus,Brain damage – There may be injury or disease of brain which may affect vision","Most people requiring visual aids have macular problems. Tests are done to assess the degree of vision and the visual field.,It includes :-,Refraction – As full a refraction as possible, should be attempted, and a subjective test should be performed with special test types. It is done to check the visual status of an individual. A trial frame and lenses should always be used, not a large refracting unit, which may interfere with eccentric viewing. Similarly, for near vision, special charts indicate reading vision and the magnification or addition required to attain a particular level.,Visual fields – It is done to assess the peripheral vision.","Many of the patients are old and frequently relatively immobile so that the retention of some ability to read is of vital importance. Low vision aids improve the reading capability and speed of reading. Visual aids for distance are less practical than those for near.,Accurate refraction and appropriate illumination should be ensured for optimal retinal image.,Magnification is the basis of most techniques used in low vision clinic. There are three methods of enlarging the retinal image :-,By bringing the object nearer to the eye.,By magnification of the retinal image.,By increasing the size of the object to be viewed.,Bringing the object nearer to the eye, leads to larger visual angle being subtended at the eye.,Magnification,  though increases the size of retinal image, leads to diminished visual field and reduced depth of focus. Due to this, lighting should be ample and directed on the fixation area. Therefore, lowest magnification compatible with useful vision should be employed .,Low vision aids may be -,Optical devices, such as magnifiers and telescopes.,Adaptive non-optical devices, such as large-print reading material and talking watches.,Non-magnifying visual aids.,Electronic devices  -   computer software.,OPTICAL  DEVICES :-,Hand-held Magnifiers  :-  Hand – held magnifiers are the simplest type of magnifiers. The hand-held magnifier design involves a handle that is attached to a plus lens through which the user views an object. Since user must support the weight of magnifier, hand-held magnifiers are helpful for short term spotting task, like reading a prescription bottle or a price tag. There are illuminated or non-illuminated magnifiers with a variety of lens designs  e.g.  aspheric , aplanatic , biconvex , and diffractive lens.,Image in Wikipedia(link is external).,Stand Magnifiers  :- Stand Magnifier is a plus lens mounted on legs that fix the distance from the lens to object. Stand Magnifiers are good for extended, near tasks such as reading a book, newspaper or magazine and making small notes. There are illuminated or non-illuminated magnifiers. There are around-the- neck  magnifiers , for jobs which require both hands to be free, like sewing and knitting.,Some magnifiers may use variations like :,Combination of lenses are also extensively used in magnifiers e.g. Hastings triplet magnifier.,Stepped lenses introduced by Fresnel can also be used as magnifiers. One type is essentially a plastic sheet with concentric ridges forming a series of prisms of increasing power from the axis to the periphery and has the great advantage of eliminating the thickness and marked aberration that would be unavoidable in a single large lens with a continuous surface.,Magnifying Reading Glasses :- Magnifying reading glasses have plus lenses for short term use as a replacement, but cannot substitute the prescription glasses. These may be having constant power or are progressive to be used for varying reading distances . These may be of illuminated type, which can be used in the dark.,Spectacle Magnifiers :-  Spectacle magnifiers are ideal for extended near tasks like reading or working on hobbies because they allow users to have ‘ hands free’. These may be:,Clip– on system :-  To be worn over the glasses.,Prismatic eye wear :-  Prisms are incorporated in spectacle to aid monocular or binocular vision. These may be bifocal, with normal reading power in upper part, and prismatic high power in the lower part for reading fine print.,Noves spectacle magnifier :-  It uses diffractive lenses which are much thinner than the lenses of similar power.,Spectacle microscope magnifiers :-  Have lenses of greater power than a traditional lens which forms a microscopic system when mounted on a spectacle lens. By holding the object closer, it allows an increase sized  image with large field of view and clarity.,Telescopes :-  Telescopes as vision aids, are ideal for tasks at any distance ( near, intermediate or far ) and for any duration of time ( short term or long term ). Telescopes may be monocular or binocular, focusable or fixed-focus, hand-held or spectacle mounted.,Technical  Magnifier :-  Technical magnifiers are ideal for extended near tasks such as inspection, quality control or viewing objects. Technical magnifiers may be hand-held magnifiers or stand magnifiers.,High power magnifiers are sometimes mounted in a cylindrical or conical holder with no handle. This is called a Loupe. These may be monocular loupe e.g. jewellers’ and watchmakers’ loupes or binocular.,Loupe : Image in Wikipedia(link is external),Binocular dental loupes: Image in Wikipedia(link is external),Aplanatic system of lenses such as exemplified in ophthalmic loupe, diminishes distortion of images.,Lamp Magnifiers :-  Lamp magnifiers sit on or clamp on to a table or desk and have illumination. These are good for extended near to intermediate tasks that need both magnification and illumination in a hands-free design.,NON- OPTICAL DEVICES :- Increasing the size of the object to be viewed helps in approach to low vision e.g. Large-size telephone bills or large-size print books. The benefits of optical devices, may be enhanced by non-optical means, such as improving light or reducing glare.,Flexible-Arm Task Lamps :-  Flexible-arm task lamps can be adjusted to a variety of tasks by providing proper light.,Full Spectrum Light Bulbs :-  Full spectrum light bulbs provide full range of colours found in sunlight, and hence more natural light. A sunscreen may be needed for longer duration of work, just as working out door in sunlight.,Absorptive Sun lenses/Sun glasses :-   Absorptive sun lenses filter out ultraviolet and infrared light. These are helpful in bright light , reduce glare and increase contrast.,Coloured Acetate Sheets z-  Coloured acetate sheets, especially yellow or marigold, when placed on the page, can enhance contrast between the print and background, making words and letters appear darker and easier to read.,NON- MAGNIFYING VISUAL AIDS :-,Stenopaeic Hole :- Stenopaeic hole is useful in any error of refraction or where the transparency of the ocular media is at fault. It is useful to a presbyope to read or write in an emergency.,As a stenopaeic slit, it may protect against ultraviolet radiation reflected from the snow.,As a reading slit cut in dark cardboard or plastic material, when placed immediately over print, may help patients with early lens opacities. In such cases, reflected light from the page is decreased and the contrast is thereby increased, allowing greater clarity in reading.,ELECTRONIC DEVICES :-,Video Magnifiers :-  Video magnifiers use video cameras to project a magnified image onto a video monitor , a television (TV ) screen, or a computer monitor. Video magnifiers use stand-mounted or hand-held video cameras and are also called ‘closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems’. Apart from the undistorted magnification, CCTV offers two other advantages. The polarity may be reversed, allowing the print to be offered as white on black, the contrast is found helpful by some patients. It is possible to isolate one line of print, which may make it more intelligible.,Hand-held video magnifiers rest against the reading material and generally have a small integrated display. Some hand-held magnifiers can project magnified image on a television.,Stand-mounted like Desktop video magnifiers have a table surface on which the object is placed. Above the object, is a camera and monitor upon which the magnified image is projected.,Newer Technologies :-  Advances in consumer electronics is improving quality of life for people with low vision. Digital devices and apps offer options for portable, lower-cost low vision aids.,E- readers - The iPad and other electronic- readers are portable, and allow the user to adjust the font size and contrast setting. They have text-to-speech functionality and can read aloud to the user. E-readers do not offer the same level of magnification as CCTVs.,Smartphones and Tablets  -  Both Apple and Android based smartphones and tablets offer a range of apps and built-in functions to help people with low vision.,Magnify,  iRead and iLoupe use camera of device, and light source to magnify and illuminate text.,SightBook app digitally communicate your vision changes to your ophthalmologist by measuring your visual function with a set of near vision tests.,Mapquest app provides voice-guided directions and tells the driver when to turn."
Lid Imbrication Syndrome,"Lid imbrication syndrome refers to abnormality of lid apposition in which upper eyelid overrides the lower eyelid. This causes lower eyelid lashes and keratinised epithelium to rub chronically against the upper eyelid marginal tarsal conjunctiva. This leads to keratinisation of the upper eyelid margin and metaplasia of the distal tarsal conjunctiva. The resulting abnormal distal superior palpebral surface, in turn, irritates the underlying corneal surface on blinking and prohibits normal replenishment of the tear film. There are symptoms of dryness due to poor tear film being produced by disruption in tear film mechanics. It may lead to persistent corneal epithelial defects.",Lid imbrication syndrome may present with symptoms such as,Lid imbrication syndrome is an idiopathic eyelid mal-position disorder and is characterized by upper eyelid overriding the lower eyelid.,Diagnosis of lid imbrication syndrome is primarily clinical.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Lagophthalmos,"Lagophthalmos is the inability to close the eyelids completely on attempted closure. The term lagophthalmos is derived from the Greek word ‘lagos’ which means ‘hare’, since the hare was believed to sleep with its eyes open.",Patients present with symptoms such as,Lagophthalmos is produced due to following three main causes,Diagnosis of lagophthalmos is primarily clinical.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Lead Poisoning,"Lead poisoning is one of the most common diseases of toxic environmental origin and accounts for about 0.6% of the global burden of disease. Lead is a naturally occurring heavy metal found in the earth’s crust.  It is soft, malleable, and melts at a relatively low temperature. It is easily moulded and can be combined with other metals to form alloys.",Most individuals when exposed to lower levels of lead show no symptoms. When symptoms of lead poisoning appear they are non specific and cannot be differentiated. Lead can seriously affect health of children.,"Lead is a heavy metal with a bluish-grey colour. It has a low melting point, and can be combined with other metals to form alloys. It is widely used in products such as pipes; storage batteries; pigments and paints; glazes; vinyl products; weights, shot and ammunition; cable covers; and radiation shielding.","Symptoms of lead poisoning are not specific. The diagnosis of lead poisoning can be suspected if possible source of exposure to lead is found during routine questions such as peeling paint in old housings combined with such behavior in children as pica, chewing on surfaces, and placing nonfood items in the mouth or proximity to open burning of waste or recycling of car batteries. Symptoms may be absent in spite of significant poisoning. Routine assessment of nutritional and developmental milestones is performed in children.",Medical interventions and treatments vary depending on the confirmed blood lead level. Simply avoiding exposure to lead might be enough to reduce low levels of lead in blood.
Lactose Intolerance,"Lactose intolerance is a condition in which some persons have digestive symptoms such as bloating, flatulence and diarrhea after consumption of foods and drinks that contain lactose. Lactose is a sugar that is naturally found in milk and milk products (such as cheese or ice cream).",Symptoms of lactose intolerance may be noticed within a few hours after ingestion of milk or milk products or other foods that contain lactose. Symptoms usually appear with in 30 minutes to two hours after lactose intake. These symptoms may include-,"Normally lactose (milk sugar) breaks down by lactase in the small intestine in to two simple sugars glucose and galactose, which are absorbed into the bloodstream through the intestinal lining. Lactase is an enzyme which helps in the process of digestion of lactose.","For diagnosis of lactose intolerance, health care provider may ask about symptoms, family and medical history, eating habits and do physical examination.",Symptoms of lactose intolerance can be managed by change in diet; to limit or avoid foods and drinks that contain lactose such as milk and milk products. Some persons can manage their symptoms by just limiting the intake of lactose while others may need to avoid lactose altogether.
Long Covid/Post-Covid Conditions,"Most people with COVID-19 recover and return to normal health within weeks of illness. However, some people experience symptoms that last for weeks or even months after recovery from acute illness.",People suffering from Long COVID experience symptoms affecting many body systems which may change overtime. These conditions can have different combinations of health problems for different lengths of time.,There are two major reasons for post-COVID-19 symptoms:,There is no simple test for diagnosing Long COVID. A clinical diagnosis can be made based on a history of COVID-19 and a failure to fully recover with development of some of the symptoms.,"There are different ways to help manage post-COVID conditions. If you think you have a post-COVID condition, talk to your healthcare provider about options for managing or treating your symptoms and resources for support."
Measles(Khasra),"Measles is an acute and highly infectious disease of childhood, transmitted by droplets from nose, mouth or throat. It is caused by viruses.   Measles is characterised by fever and upper respiratory tract symptoms like cough and cold (coryza). The rash of measles is typical. This occurs all over the world and lead to significant morbidity and mortality in children.",The classical signs and symptoms of measles include fever for  4 to 6 days and the three C's i.e:fever for  4 to 6 days and the three C's i.e:,"It is an infection of the respiratory system caused by a virus, specifically a paramyxovirus which is a single-stranded, negative-sense, enveloped RNA virus of the genus Morbillivirus within the family Paramyxoviridae. Humans are the natural hosts of the virus.","Diagnosis of measles requires a history of fever of at least three days, with at least one of the three C's (cough, coryza, conjunctivitis).",There is no specific treatment for measles. Most patients with uncomplicated measles will recover with rest and supportive treatment.
Malaria,Malaria is a disease having symptoms of recurrent fever with chill and headache. After onset of fever it subsides after sometimes and again reoccurs. In severe cases it can progress to coma or even death. It is caused by parasites known as Plasmodium. It commences with the bite of female Anopheles mosquitoes which carries this parasite.,Symptoms of malaria can develop in seven days after the bite from the infected mosquito. Typical symptoms include:,"Malaria parasites belong to the genus Plasmodium. In humans, malaria is caused by P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale, P. vivax. The life cycle of parasite completes in mosquitoes and human.",Malaria can be diagnosed by the doctor based on the patient’s history (fever with chill and rigor) followed by the clinical assessment (enlargement of liver and spleen).,"The treatment chosen will depend upon whether the patient has vivax malaria or falciparum malaria as diagnosed by the blood test, age of the patient, the pregnancy status of the female patient and location of the patient."
Meningitis,"Meningitis  is a disease caused by the inflammation of thin lining covering the brain and spinal cord known as meninges. The infection of the fluids surrounding the brain and spinal cord leads to inflammation of meninges. The severity of illness and treatment of meningitis differ depending on the cause. So, its important to know the specific cause of meningitis.","The most common symptom of meningitis is severe headache , followed by nuchal rigidity (the inability to  flex the neck forward passively due to increased neck muscle tone and stiffness).","Meningitis is typically caused by an infection with microorganisms. Most infections are due to viruses with bacteria, fungi, and protozoa being the next most common causes.",Diagnostic tests for meningitis include:,Meningitis is a life-threatening disease and has a high mortality rate if untreated.
Migraine,"Migraine is a  neurological disorder often described as intense pulsing or throbbing pain in one area of the head. Typically the headache is unilateral (affecting one half of the head) and pulsating in nature, lasting from 2 to 72 hours.","Symptoms of migraine can be divided into stages. There are five distinct stages of migraine, though not everyone goes through all the stages:","Exact cause of migraine is still not known. Though various trigger factors are associated with physiological factors, such as:",The diagnosis of migraine is based on signs and symptoms.,"There is currently no cure for migraines. Pain killers like paracetamol and aspirin are very effective to combat migraine.Triptans such as sumatriptan (imitrex), rizatriptan (maxalt) are also effective in relieving the pain and other symptoms that are associated with migraines."
Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack),"Myocardial Infarction(MI) also known as heart attack is one of the most common non-communicable diseases/ chronic diseases, which cannot be transmitted from person to person. It gradually progresses  and affects the blood supply to heart.","Generally, symptoms appear gradually. Chest pain is the most common symptom of acute myocardial infarction.,It is often associated with","Rate of heart attacks is generally higher with intense exertion, it can also be due to psychological stress or physical exertion.,Risk factors associated with MI are:","According to the WHO criteria as revised in 2000, a cardiac troponin rise accompanied by either typical symptoms, pathological Q waves, ST elevation or depression or coronary intervention are diagnostic of MI.",Oxygen and aspirin are usually administered as soon as possible.
Microcephaly,"Microcephaly is a condition where a baby is born with a small head or the head stops growing after birth. Microcephaly is neonatal malformation defined as a head size much smaller compared with other babies of the same age and sex. Microcephaly can occur as an isolated condition, or it can occur in combination with other major birth defects.",Babies with microcephaly can have different types of symptoms depending upon the severity of microcephaly. Some children with microcephaly will develop entirely normally. Many babies born with microcephaly may show no other symptoms at birth but go on to develop:,"There are various factors which cause microcephaly in newborns, but often cause remains unknown. The most common causes include following:",During the pregnancy:,There is no standard treatment for microcephaly. Sometimes medications are needed to treat seizures or other symptoms.
Mooren'S Ulcer,"Mooren’s Ulcer is a painful, progressive, and chronic disease of the cornea, which often is bilateral and may cause severe vision loss or even loss of the eye. It is characterised by painful peripheral corneal ulceration of unknown aetiology. The disease generally begins with intense limbal inflammation and swelling in episclera and conjunctiva. Corneal changes begin 2- 3mm from the limbus as grey swelling that rapidly furrows. It affects superficial one- third of cornea and then it progresses circumferentially and centrally. There is usually infiltration and undermining of the leading edge of the circumferential peri-limbal ulceration. The bed of the furrow becomes vascularised with vessels advancing into the base of the undermined edges. The central edges of the ulcer can develop an overhanging edge extending from limbus into the ulcer bed, with or without opacification and neovascularisation. Neovascularisation may occur up to the advancing edge of the ulcer but not beyond it. Tissue destruction and ulceration of the cornea is initially confined to the periphery, but it may progress in some patients to involve the entire cornea. Destruction of the cornea generally affects stromal tissue only, leaving behind an intact epithelium and endothelium. The ulcers are crescent- shaped and may leave behind either an opaque oedematous cornea or is replaced with a thin fibro-vascular membrane. It does not affect underlying Descemet’s membrane. There is no associated scleral inflammation. Intense pain is a hallmark of Mooren’s ulcer, which is generally lacking in other peripheral ulcerative keratitis. The disease may be refractory to all forms of available therapy.",Mooren’s ulcer may produce symptoms such as:,"The cause of Mooren’s ulcer is unknown, but evidence suggests an autoimmune basis. Supportive evidence includes:","By definition, primary Mooren’s ulcer is not associated with any systemic abnormality, except for the occasional association with hepatitis C. It is not associated with scleritis, which distinguishes it from other more common types of peripheral ulcerative keratitis associated with collagen vascular disease. Patients having other systemic disease including leukaemia, pyoderma gangrenosum and syphilis may also develop peripheral ulcerative keratitis. This classic idiopathic variety may manifest as either type I or type II.",Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (Mers‐Cov),"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The novel coronavirus was named as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS‐CoV.",The clinical presentation of MERS-CoV infection may be asymptomatic showing no symptoms or may show mild respiratory symptoms to severe acute respiratory disease and death.,"MERS-CoV is a zoonotic virus, which means virus can be transmitted between animals and people. Humans have got infection with MERS-CoV through direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels. Dromedary camels are the major reservoir host for MERS-CoV and an animal source of infection in humans. It is believed that in past the virus may have originated in bats and then transmitted to camels.",There are two tests to detect MERS-CoV infection.,Treatment is supportive and based on the patient’s clinical condition. Severe illness can result into respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit.

Mumps,"Mumps is a viral infection and most often a mild disease of childhood. It affects children between five and nine years of age. However, the mumps can affect both adolescents and adults. Mumps virus is present throughout the world. It spreads by airborne droplets released when an infected person sneezes or coughs and by direct contact with an infected person. In temperate climates the disease incidence is peak in winter and spring while in hot climates the disease may occur at any time of year. Many countries experience epidemics at intervals of 2–5 years. Humans are the only known host for mumps virus. It primarily affects the salivary glands and it is sometimes called infectious parotitis.","After an incubation period (the period between infection and the appearance of signs of a disease) of some two to four weeks mumps begins with non-specific symptoms such as myalgia, headache, malaise and low-grade fever.",Mumps is a viral disease caused by a virus (mumps virus) belongs to the genus Rubulavirus of the family Paramyxoviridae. It primarily affects the salivary glands. The incubation time (the period between infection and the appearance of signs of a disease) averages 16–18 days with a range of two to four weeks.,"Complete blood cell count (CBC) - A complete blood cell count reveals a normal, decreased, or elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, with predominating lymphocytes in differential count.","Conservative, supportive medical care is indicated for patients with mumps. No antiviral agent is indicated for treatment of this viral illness, as mumps is a self-limited disease. No specific therapy for mumps exists."
Madarosis,"Madarosis is defined as the loss or absence of eyelashes (ciliary madarosis) or eyebrows (superciliary madarosis) or both. The term madarosis was originally coined to denote loss of eyelashes due to destruction of hair follicles. But now, this term encompasses loss of cilia either of eyelashes or eyebrows or both. Loss of eyelashes is also known as milphosis. Madarosis as a clinical sign has varied aetiology. This may be a manifestation of local or systemic diseases. Chronic blepharitis is one of the common causes of madarosis. It may be scarring or non-scarring type, depending upon the aetiology.",Symptoms of madarosis are mainly cosmetic.,Causes of madarosis are varied and include,Diagnosis depends upon clinical history and examination of eyes (both eyebrows and eyelids) including facial skin and scalp.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Mastitis,"Mastitis is inflammation of the breast, which may or may not be accompanied by infection. Mastitis is more common in the lactational phase affecting one in five breastfeeding women. 74% to 95% cases of mastitis occur in the first 12 weeks after child birth especially in the second and third week postpartum. It is one of the reasons for early discontinuation of breastfeeding, which provides optimal infant nutrition",Breast pain is the primary symptom of mastitis. Other symptoms and signs of mastitis are:,"Milk stasis and infection are two important causes of mastitis. Milk stasis is usually the primary cause, which may or may not be accompanied by or progress to infection.","Most cases of mastitis are diagnosed clinically. Medical care provider/doctor will ask about the various symptoms fever, pain, lactational history, and any medicinal intake. On clinical examination of the breast he/she will focus on looking for signs of inflammation (erythema, localised tenderness, heat, engorgement and swelling) and nipple damage.",Management of mastitis consist of effective milk removal and antibiotics if infection is suspected.
Mouth Ulcers,"Mouth ulcers are usually pale or yellow painful sores with a red outer ring. These appear inside mouth, on the cheeks, lips and sometimes can also appear on the tongue. Usually a single ulcer inside mouth may be due to cheek or tongue biting, or damage caused by sharp teeth, aggressive brushing or poorly fitting dentures. These ulcers are known as ‘traumatic' ulcers. More than one ulcer inside mouth which are recurrent in nature are called Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis (RAS).","Aphthous ulcers present as well-circumscribed lesions with central necrotic region of gray, fibrinous exudate surrounded by an erythematous halo on the non-keratinised oral mucosa. Pain severity depends on the type of ulcer. Typical locations of ulcers include the buccal (cheek) and labial (lip) mucosa, the floor of the mouth, the ventral surface of the tongue, and the soft palate.","Aphthous ulcers are idiopathic (exact cause is not clear) and multifactorial, but likely involves activation of the cell-mediated immune system.","Based on the clinical examination and on the patient’s medical history, a diagnosis of aphthous ulcers is determined.",
Malocclusion,Malocclusion is the misalignment of teeth of upper or lower jaw or both jaws.,"Malocclusion may not have any symptoms, except unacceptable facial and dental appearance. Protruded teeth, crowding, or spacing between teeth are signs of malocclusion. Sometimes there may be difficulty in chewing, speech problems and teeth may show signs of wear and tear.",According to Graber malocclusion may occur due to the involvement of-,"It can be diagnosed during routine dental examination. If malocclusion is present, photographs, dental impressions, and x-rays are required for further assessment and treatment of the condition.",
Mucormycosis,"Mucormycosis (black fungus) is a fungal infection caused by a group of fungi called mucormycetes. These fungi are naturally found in air, water and even food. It enters in the body after inhaling fungal spores from the air and commonly affects sinuses and lungs. It can also infect skin after a cut, burn, or skin injury. It is a rare infection.","Symptoms of mucormycosis vary, depending on which organ/part of the human body it infects.",Mucormycosis is a fungal infection caused by a group of fungi called mucormycetes. These fungi are naturally found in the soil and decaying organic matter like decaying vegetation.,"Medical history, symptoms, physical examination and laboratory tests are required for the diagnosis of mucormycosis.",Mucormycosis is a serious infection and needs to be treated with intravenous (through a vein) anti-fungal medicine.
Mouth Breathing,"Breathing is a vital function of the human body, normally done through the nose. Abnormal, habitual breathing through the mouth instead of the nose is known as mouth breathing. It is a common clinical problem in children and is detrimental to their health. Mouth breathing may be due to blockage in nasal passage, deviated nasal septum, enlarged adenoids or an infection in the nose & throat. Mouth breathers with enlarged adenoids (a mass of tissue at the back of the nasal cavity) develop “Adenoid Faces” manifested by elongated face with an expressionless and open-mouthed appearance. Mouth breathing may cause dryness of mouth leading to bad breath and gingivitis. Classification of mouth breathing and determining its type in a patient is very important for effective treatment. Obstructive mouth breathing is best treated by a rhinologist, whereas habitual mouth breathing is corrected by a pedodontist or orthodontist.","Mouth breathing has general, extra-oral, and intra-oral symptoms.","Enlarged nasal turbinates (network of bones in the nasal passageways) due to allergies, infections, pollution, or hot and dry climatic conditions and enlarged tonsils or adenoids,Intranasal defects such as deviated nasal septum, thickness of septum, allergic rhinitis, and nasal polyps,Hereditary,Short upper lip,Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome","Identification of the exact cause of mouth breathing is important for its treatment. Clinical and functional tests are performed to differentiate it from habitual mouth breathing. Diagnosis is made on the basis of patient’s history of repeated respiratory infections, clinical examination of the patient such as extra-oral and intra-oral examination, observing patient’s breathing and checking for nasal voice. If required, an ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat) specialist can also be consulted.",
Monkeypox,"Monkeypox is a viral zoonotic disease (it can spread from animals to humans) with symptoms very similar to those seen previously in smallpox patients, although the illness is less severe.",The clinical presentation of monkeypox resembles that of smallpox which was declared eradicated worldwide in 1980. Monkeypox is less contagious than smallpox and causes less severe illness. The incubation period (interval from infection to onset of symptoms) of monkeypox is usually from 5 to 21 days.,"Monkeypox disease is caused by the monkeypox virus. Monkeypox virus belongs to the Orthopoxvirus genus in the family Poxviridae. The Orthopoxvirus genus also includes variola virus (which causes smallpox), vaccinia virus (used in the smallpox vaccine), and cowpox virus)","Monkeypox must be clinically differentiated from other rash illnesses, such as chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, syphilis, herpes simplex virus, molluscum contagiosum virus, enterovirus, parapoxviruses (causing orf and related conditions), chancroid and medication associated allergies.","Symptoms of Monkeypox often resolve on their own without any specific treatment. Clinical care for monkeypox mainly consists of measures to reduce symptoms, manage complications and prevent long-term sequelae."
Narcolepsy,"Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder caused by the brain's inability to regulate sleep-wake cycles. It is a disorder in which a person falls asleep at inappropriate times. People with narcolepsy generally experience disturbed nocturnal sleep and an abnormal daytime sleep pattern, which is often confused with insomnia.","Excessive Daytime Sleepiness:,The main characteristic of narcolepsy is Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS) in which even after adequate night time sleep. A person becomes drowsy or fall asleep or just be very tired throughout the day, often at inappropriate times and places.",Narcolepsy is known to be caused by an autoimmune response.,"Diagnosis is relatively easy when all the symptoms of narcolepsy are present, but if the sleep attacks are isolated and cataplexy is mild or absent, diagnosis is more difficult. It is also possible for cataplexy to occur in isolation . Three tests that are commonly used in diagnosing narcolepsy are:","There is no specific cure of the disease. One of the best ways to manage excessive daytime sleepiness is to take frequent, brief naps evenly spaced through the day."
Nasal Polyps,Nasal polyps are polypoidal masses arising mainly from the mucous membranes of the nose and paranasal sinuses. They are overgrowths of the mucosa that frequently accompany allergic rhinitis. They are freely movable and non tender.,The symptoms of polyps can include:,"Nasal polyps are thought to occur as a result of inflammation in the lining (mucus membrane) of the nasal cavities and sinuses. While the exact cause of nasal polyps is not known.,Various risk factors involved:",Nasal polyps are mostly diagnosed through symptoms:,Nasal polyps are generally treated through steroid nasal spray and medications.
Neonatal Respiratory Disease Syndrome(Nrds),"It is also called as Infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS). It is a serious medical condition where a newborn baby's lungs cannot provide their body with enough oxygen. NRDS is also known as hyaline membrane disease, infant respiratory distress syndrome or newborn respiratory distress syndrome.","Along with tachypnea and tachycardia.,There include:",It is caused by developmental deficiency of surfactant (slippery and protective substance) production and structural immaturity in the lungs. It can also result from a genetic problem with the production of surfactant associated proteins.,These tests may include:,"Babies that are born premature or are at high risk for the respiratory diseases, should be treated at birth by a medical team that specializes in newborn breathing problems."
Neuralgia,"Neuralgia is pain in one or more nerves caused by a change in neurological structure or function of the nerves rather than by excitation of healthy pain receptors.,Types of trigeminal neuralgia,Trigeminal neuralgia can be divided into different categories depending on the type of pain. These are described below.,Trigeminal neuralgia type 1 (TN1) is the classic form of trigeminal neuralgia. The piercing and stabbing pain can occur at any time and is not constant. This type of neuralgia is known as idiopathic (when no cause can be identified),Trigeminal neuralgia type 2 (TN2) can be referred to as atypical (not typical) trigeminal neuralgia. Pain is more constant and involves aching, throbbing and burning sensations,Symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia (STN) is when pain results from an underlying cause, such as multiple sclerosis,References: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,www.ninds.nih.gov,www.nlm.nih.gov,www.nhs.uk",The main symptom of neuralgia is a sudden severe stabbing or piercing pain in the area of distribution of concerned nerve. It can be due to irritation or damage to the nerve.,Causes of neuralgia include:,Diagnosis of neuralgia can be difficult at times. It can be diagnosed with the help of tests like:,"Treatment include both medicines and surgery,"
Nipah Virus Infection,"Nipah virus (NiV) infection is a new emerging zoonotic disease (transmissible from animals to humans) affecting both animals (pigs and other domestic animals) and humans. Fruit bats of the Pteropodidae Family, Pteropus genus are the natural host for the virus.",Symptoms of disease may appear with in 5 to 14 days (incubation period) after an exposure to infection:,"Nipah virus (NiV) infection is caused by a virus, that is named after the Malaysian village where it was first discovered. NiV is a member of the family Paramyxoviridae, genus Henipavirus.",Laboratory confirmation of NiV Infection in a suspected case of NiV can be done during the acute and convalescent phases of the disease by using a combination of tests.,"There is no effective treatment for NiV disease, Intensive supportive care is the primary treatment for human cases, though use of an antiviral medication (ribavarin ) may reduce the symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and convulsions."
Neonatal Conjunctivitis,"Neonatal conjunctivitis (Ophthalmia neonatorum) is defined as a conjunctival inflammation that occurs during first month of life after birth. Various causes have been implicated such as bacterial, viral including chemical conjunctivitis. Complications may be mild such as hyperaemia with scant conjunctival discharge to permanent scarring leading to even blindness.",Manifestations of neonatal conjunctivitis depend upon the aetiological agent and its incubation period (period between infection of an individual by a pathogen and the manifestation of the illness).,The main causes of neonatal conjunctivitis are:,Diagnosis depends upon the clinical presentation and lab investigations.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Neurotrophic Keratopathy,"Neurotrophic keratopathy (NK), Neurotrophic keratitis or Trigeminal neuropathic keratopathy is a rare degenerative corneal disease. It is characterised by lack of or decreased corneal sensation, corneal epithelial breakdown and impaired healing, resulting into increased susceptibility of the corneal surface to injury and compromised healing. In severe cases this can lead to stromal melting, corneal ulceration and even perforation.","Patients commonly do not complain of ocular surface symptoms, since corneal sensory innervation is compromised in neurotrophic keratopathy. Therefore, patients may not seek medical advice for months or even years after the onset of the disease.","The causes of neurotrophic keratopathy are all those conditions that decrease sensitivity of cornea. The most common are herpes infections of the cornea, surgery for trigeminal neuralgia, and surgery for acoustic neuroma.","Diagnosis of neurotrophic keratopathy is based on the clinical history, findings and evaluation of corneal sensitivity. Testing of corneal nerve sensitivity and imaging of corneal nerves aid in the management of NK patients who cannot have corneal transplantation.",Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Nausea And Vomiting Of Pregnancy And  Hyperemesis Gravidarum,"Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is a common condition during early pregnancy. Around half of all pregnant women experience vomiting, and more than 80% of women experience nausea in the first 12 weeks. It is often called morning sickness as the symptoms are usually worse in the morning but can occur at any time of the day, and sometimes continue throughout the day.","Symptoms of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy are variable from woman to woman in its severity, such as from decreased appetite to low level nausea and vomiting. Pregnant woman is still able to eat and drink fluids some of the time with these symptoms.","The exact cause of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy is not known. However, it is believed that rapidly rising blood level of human chorionic gonadotropin hormone released by the placenta during pregnancy may cause morning sickness.","Medical history, symptoms and physical examination and pregnancy test are sufficient to diagnose nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum (HG). Sometimes it is important to rule out other medical reasons for vomiting in a pregnant woman with HG or if nausea and vomiting occur  with following symptoms-","For nausea and vomiting in pregnancy women may usually not seek help because of concerns about the safety of medications. However, the experts note that treating nausea and vomiting early in pregnancy, before it progresses, can help control symptoms and prevent more serious complications, including hospitalization. Management includes non-pharmacologic therapies and pharmacologic therapies."
Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease(Nafld),Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease(NAFLD) is a leading cause of chronic liver diseases globally. NAFLD is a medical condition in which excess fat deposits in the liver. This deposition of fat is not caused by heavy alcohol use.,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are silent diseases, usually show few or no symptoms. Symptoms may be in the form of tiredness and discomfort in upper right side of abdomen.",NAFLD is more common in people who have following conditions,"Early detection of NAFLD is useful to identify those with potentially silent progressive fatty liver disease. Diagnostic practice for NAFLD includes medical history, clinical, biochemical and radiographic tests.","Lifestyle intervention plays an important role in the management of NAFLD. Calorie restriction and physical activity with weight loss are crucial ways in lifestyle intervention. Both aerobic and resistance exercises with a reduction in intake of simple sugars, industrial fructose, and saturated fats are essential for weight management."
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,"Have you ever wondered regarding the unusual behaviour of some persons when they do certain acts repeatedly seemingly without any logical reason like someone repeatedly washing hands, cleaning again and again when it is not needed, taking unusually long time like hours in bathing, taking unusually long time like hours in getting ready, extremely particular about things being arranged or about symmetry , or someone reports getting repetitive thoughts that he or she doesn’t want to think for e.g. violent or sexual thoughts or images  etc, then the person should get himself or herself evaluated by a psychiatrist as these may be the symptoms of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder(OCD).",Obsessive Compulsive Disorder: It’s a disorder characterised by,"OCD & related disorders are a result of complex multi factorial Bio-psycho-social causes. They are complex disorders like heart disease or Diabetes mellitus type-1 and the current research says they are a result of complex interaction of genetic, biological, psychological, social and developmental factors.  So one can have an OCD and related diorder because of a combination of the following factors.",Obsessive Compulsive disorder & related disorders can be diagnosed by,Obsessive compulsive and related disorders are treatable and majority of patients lead a quality life with proper and regular treatment.

Most oral cancers look very similar under the microscope and are called squamous cell carcinoma.",Symptoms include:,Oncogenes (genes that causes cancer) are activated as a result of mutation of the DNA.,Biopsy,Surgery
Osteomyelitis,"Osteomyelitis refers to a bone infection, usually caused by a bacteria. This can result in the destruction of the bone itself. It can be characterized as:",The most common symptoms are bone pain and high fever:,"It is generally caused due to bacteria especially staphylococcus aureus.,It is generally seen in children and if it is seen in adults it is due to:","Physical examination,To confirm a diagnosis of osteomyelitis, doctor may carry out a physical examination of affected body part to check for redness, swelling and tenderness.",In Acute cases: Antibiotics are used as successful line of treatment.
Osteoporosis,"Osteoporosis is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a bone mineral density of 2.5 standard deviations or more below the mean peak bone mass (average of young, healthy adults) as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The term ""established osteoporosis"" includes the presence of a fragility fracture. It is a medical condition that affects the bones, causing them to become weak and fragile and more likely to break (fracture).,Common form of osteoporosis:","Osteoporosis develops slowly over several years. Sometime a minor fall or sudden impact can cause a bone to fracture. Typical fragility fractures occur in the vertebral column, rib, hip and wrist.,Symptoms include:","Osteoporosis may be caused due to decrease in density of bones.,Risk Factors:","Osteoporosis is often diagnosed after the weakening of the bones has led to a fracture. Diagnosis can be made on suspicion when patient approaches a doctor for any other reason or x-ray is done otherwise and bones appear weak.,Conventional radiography,Conventional radiography is used either alone or in conjunction with CT or MRI, for detecting complications of osteopenia (reduced bone mass preosteoporosis). However, radiography is relatively insensitive to detection of early disease and requires a substantial amount of bone loss (about 30%) to be apparent on X-ray images. The main radiographic features of generalized osteoporosis are cortical thinning and increased radiolucency. Involvement of multiple vertebral bodies leads to kyphosis of the thoracic spine, leading to what is known as dowager's hump.,Dual-energy X-ray,Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is diagnosed when the bone mineral density is less than or equal to 2.5 standard deviations below that of a young (30–40-year-old) healthy adult women reference population. This is translated as a T-score.,Biomarkers,Chemical biomarkers are a useful tool in detecting bone degradation. The enzyme cathepsin K breaks down type-I collagen protein, an important constituent in bones. Antibodies recognizes the resulting fragment, called a neoepitope, as a way to diagnose osteoporosis. Increased urinary excretion of C-telopeptides, a type-I collagen breakdown product, also serves as a biomarkers for osteoporosis.,Reference: www.nhs.uk","Lifestyle,Tobacco smoking and high alcohol intake have been linked with osteoporosis. Cessation of smoking and moderation of alcohol intake are commonly recommended.,Nutrition,Vitamin D and calcium supplements together can result in preventing fractures. However, there is an increased risk of myocardial infarctions and kidney stones with excess of these supplements.,Medications,Bisphosphonates are useful in decreasing the risk of future fractures. Teriparatide (a recombinant parathyroid hormone) has been shown to be effective in treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis."
Otitis Media,"It is a middle ear infection. Sometimes ear infections can be painful and may even need antibiotics. It is very common in childhood. Most ear infections occur in infants between the age of 6-18 months, though anyone can get an ear infection. For reasons that are unclear they are more common in boys than girls.",Main symptoms of otitis media include:,"Otitis media (middle ear infection) is caused when a bacterial or viral infection, such as a cold, spreads into a part of the ear known as the Eustachian tube.",Tests to be conducted are described below:,"Antibiotics:,The first line antibiotic treatment is amoxicillin . Among short-course antibiotics, long-acting azithromycin is found more likely to be successful than short-acting alternatives . If there is no improvement after 2–3 days of treatment a change in therapy may be considered."
Orbital Dermoid,"Orbital dermoid is a congenital benign cystic teratoma (choristoma) that originates from aberrant ectodermal tissue. In these tumours, there is embryonic displacement of epidermis to a subcutaneous location along embryonic lines of closure. As two suture lines of skull close during embryonic development, epidermal or dermal elements may pinch off and form cysts. Orbital dermoids are not attached to the skin.",Orbital dermoid may present as:,Dermoids are produced due to entrapment of embryonic epithelial nests when foetal suture lines close during embryogenesis.,Diagnosis depends upon the presenting history and clinical examination.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Ocular Graft-Versus-Host Disease,"Ocular graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a complication of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), where an immunologic response by donor cells against host tissues occurs due to incompatibility between the recipient and donor cells. Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a common treatment for haematologic, immunologic, metabolic and neoplastic diseases. HSCT is limited due to GVHD, which is a major cause of morbidity following allogeneic HSCT. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) markers are the most important factors, triggering the immune response and leading to the onset of GVHD.",Ocular (eye) manifestations vary widely.,Established risk factors associated with the development of GVHD which affect the severity of clinical presentation are:,"A thorough patient history and ocular examination is necessary for the clinical diagnosis of ocular GVHD. Essential components of the history include extent of systemic GVHD, as well as systemic medications taken.",Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Obesity,"Obesity is a condition where a person has accumulated abnormal or excessive body fat that causes negative effects on health. For an individual, obesity is usually the result of an imbalance between calories consumed and calories expanded. An increased consumption of high calorie foods, without an equal increase in physical activity leads to an increase in weight. Decreased levels of physical activity will also result in an energy imbalance and lead to weight gain.",Weight gain usually occurs over time. Most people know when they've gained weight. Some of the signs of overweight or obesity include:,"Obesity doesn't occur overnight. It develops gradually over time when there is disturbance in energy balance. Energy balance means that “energy in” through food intake and “energy out” through physical activities. Consuming excess calories from high-fat foods, sugars and doing little or no daily physical activity over the long time will lead to weight gain. The reasons for the imbalance between calorie intake and energy out may vary from individual to individual.",(a) Assessment of obesity,"For most people who are overweight or obese, the safest and most effective way to lose weight is setting goals with life style changes such as eating fewer calories and being physically active. If lifestyle changes are not enough then only medicines and weight loss surgery are options. While suffering from any co-morbid condition such as diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis consult your physician prior to starting life style changes."
Osteoarthritis,"Osteoarthrithis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis in both developed and developing countries.  It is a chronic, progressive musculoskeletal disorder characterized by gradual loss of cartilage in joints which results in bones rubbing together and creating stiffness, pain, and impaired movement. The disease most commonly affects the joints in the knees, hips, hands, feet, and spine. The disease is associated with modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors such as obesity, lack of exercise, genetic predisposition, bone density, occupational injury, trauma, and gender.","The main symptoms of OA are pain, loss of ability, and “joint stiffness after exercise or use.” These symptoms are often aggravated by activity or rigorous exercise and relieved during rest. The disease may eventually progress to the point where the patient even feels pain during rest. Some people report pain so intense that it wakes them up when they are sleeping.",Risk Factors for occurrence and progression of osteoarthritis-,Commonly the doctor can diagnose OA on clinical examination with the following signs and symptoms:,"Management of the patient with OA should be comprehensive and individualized, taking into account the joint involved, the phase and the progression rate of the disease, co-morbid conditions such as cardiac disease, hypertension, peptic ulcer disease or renal disease, as well as the patient’s needs and expectations. Management plan should be regularly reviewed which is broadly divided into non-pharmacological, pharmacological, and surgical treatments. Non-pharmacological treatments should be started first, followed by pharmacological treatment and then surgery if the first two are unsuccessful."
Orbital Varix,"Orbital varix is a tumour (vascular hamartoma) which comprises of collection of venous channels. Primary varix may be a congenital lesion or it may be acquired following trauma. Orbital varix may be distensible or non-distensible. It presents with intermittent proptosis which increases with straining, crying or stooping.",Wright (1974) has classified initial symptoms of orbital varices into five groups as,Venous varices are rare orbital lesions which causes characteristic intermittent proptosis.,Clinical features,Management of orbital varix is difficult.
Orbital Fat Prolapse,Orbital fat prolapse is produced due to extrusion of intraconal (inside the extra-ocular muscle cone) orbital fat beneath the conjunctiva.,Patient usually presents for cosmetic reason.,"Mostly orbital fat prolapse is due to ageing as is seen in older adults, but it may be seen in children as well.",Diagnosis is clinical.,Lesions usually do not require any treatment.
Orbital Cavernous Haemangioma,"Cavernous Haemangioma is the most common primary orbital tumour in adults. This lesion consists of angiographically silent venous malformation. The classification of Cavernous haemangioma is a misnomer. It is usually centered on intraconal compartment of orbit and may contain phleboliths visible on imaging. Cavernous haemangioma consists of venous malformation having vascular spaces lined with endothelium and a fibrous pseudo-capsule. Rarely, cavernous haemangioma may be intra-osseous, and thus lies in extraconal compartment.",Symptoms may include,Cavernous haemangioma is a benign tumour that is usually seen in adults as relatively stationary or slowly progressive mass. It is a hamartoma composed of dilated large vascular spaces.,"Clinically, Cavernous haemangioma present as a relatively stationary or slowly progressive benign tumour that may produce painless proptosis. Increased growth may be seen following trauma or in pregnancy. Since it occurs in muscle cone, it produces axial proptosis. It is generally not associated with inflammatory signs. Visual function is usually not affected. Since the proptosis is in straight ahead position, binocular vision may not be compromised. With marked proptosis, the constituent vessels may get engorged as in the act of crying.",Conservative therapy
Orbital Solitary Fibrous Tumour,"Orbital Solitary Fibrous Tumour (SFT) is an uncommon benign spindle cell tumour with characteristics of mesenchymal fibroblast- like cells. It was originally recognised in the pleura. It is also seen in peritoneum, mediastinum, deep soft tissues of extremities, and conjunctiva as well.",SFT most commonly presents in middle-aged patients with symptoms such as,Orbital solitary fibrous tumour is an uncommon benign spindle cell tumour with ultra structural and immuno-histochemical characteristics of mesenchymal fibroblast like cells.,"Orbital solitary fibrous tumour is unilateral and occurs in both adults and children. Patient generally presents with proptosis and displacement of eyeball due to mass effect. It usually show slow clinical course without vision loss or significant pain. It may occur supero-temporally and may simulate lacrimal gland tumour. It may simultaneously involve orbit and nasal cavity. Occasionally, SFT may be aggressive and can extend to the central nervous system. Malignant transformation and metastasis are rare.","Complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice. Incomplete removal increases the risk of clinical recurrence of tumour. Therefore, close follow up is required in cases with suspected residual tumour. Adjunctive radiation therapy is used in highly cellular lesions."
Orbital Haemangiopericytoma,"Orbital haemangiopericytoma is a rare soft-tissue neoplasm. This tumour originates from pericytes found around capillaries. Pericyte is a spindle shaped cell with a moderate amount of cytoplasm and an indistinct border. Routine histopathologic differentiation of pericyte from fibroblast, histiocyte and endothelial cell is difficult. Cellular differentiation may be best achieved by electron microscopy and immune-histochemistry.The function of pericytes is uncertain but is believed to provide mechanical support to the capillaries. Pericytes morphologically resemble smooth muscle. Besides the muscle cone of the eye, this tumour may also affect optic nerve meninges and lacrimal sac. This rare tumour is commonly encountered in lower extremities and retro-peritoneum.",Symptoms may include,"There is controversy about the existence of haemangiopericytoma. Its derivation from pericytes is questioned and cases have been reclassified as solitary fibrous tumours, based on histopathologic and immune-histochemical findings. Traditionally, it has been categorised as vascular tumour.","Orbital haemangiopericytoma occurs mainly in adults and has similar symptoms, signs, and imaging studies as cavernous haemangioma. Haemangiopericytoma may be more aggressive with time, extend throughout the orbit, and even invade the cranial cavity.",Management of the tumours is mainly surgical.
Orbital Lymphangioma,"Orbital Lymphangioma is an intra-orbital, non-encapsulated, congenital vascular tumour with a propensity for recurrent haemorrhage. Lymphangioma is a benign vascular hamartoma commonly noticed in head and neck area. Vascular mesenchyme that has differentiated abnormaly into isolated lymphatic- like spaces with no connection to the systemic circulation,may be the cause. Lymphangioma is a common vascular tumour in children and commonly presents in age group less than ten years. However, it is, sometimes detected later in life following trauma and intralesional haemorrhage. There are two growth patterns of lymphangioma (slow or rapidly explosive). Slow enlargement takes place over decades, producing progressive proptosis. In contrast, explosive growth results from intralesional haemorrhage arising from intrinsic nutrient vessels, or in association with an upper respiratory tract infection with proliferation of lymphoid tissue. In contrast to capillary haemangioma, lymphangiomas do not regress spontaneously. These tumours may become encapsulated due to normal bodily reaction to prevent expansion.",Patient may present with symptoms such as,"Lymphangioma is likely to be derived from vascular mesenchyme that has differentiated abnormaly into isolated lymphatic- like spaces with no connection to the systemic circulation. They are benign hamartomatous vascular tumours, which differ from haemangiomas in that they do not display proliferating endothelial cells.","Clinically, the tumours may be located superficially in the orbit and are cystic. More commonly, these are infiltrative and diffuse in the orbit. Lymphangioma, located apically or with intracranial extension, is more likely to be associated with sub-mucosal oral lesions and intracranial vascular anomalies.",Management includes
Psoriasis,"It is an immune-mediated condition that affects the skin. It causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales. The condition is not infectious and most people are affected only in small patches on their body. Psoriasis occurs when the immune system mistakes a normal skin cell for a pathogen, and sends out faulty signals that cause overproduction of new skin cells.","Plaque psoriasis,Its symptoms are dry, red skin lesions, known as plaques, that are covered in silver scales.,Guttate psoriasis:,It causes small (less than 1cm or 1/3 inch) drop-shaped sores on your chest, arms, legs and scalp","Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease, in which part of the body’s own immune system becomes overactive and attacks normal tissues in the body.",A diagnosis of psoriasis is usually based on the appearance of the skin there are no special blood tests or diagnostic procedures.,"Bland emollients and moisturizers, mineral oil, and petroleum jelly may help soothe affected skin"
Post Menopausal Bleeding,"Postmenopausal bleeding is a condition in which  vaginal bleeding  occurs at least 12 months after woman periods have stopped. Once a woman is at her menopausal age (45-49 years normally) has lasted 12 months without a period, she is believed to be in menopause stage.",,"Several health conditions are associated with postmenopausal bleeding, these conditions include:",For diagnosing the exact cause. Doctor may ask for the medical history  and may conduct a pap smear test.,"Treatment depends on the cause of the post menopausal bleeding:,If bleeding is due to polyps, surgery may be required to remove them.,Endometrial atrophy can be treated with medication such as oestrogen cream or pessaries , If post menopausal bleeding is due to   endometrial hyperplasia, it  might be treated with hormone treatment (progestin) or total hysterectomy (surgery to remove cervix, uterus and ovaries)  .,If post menausal bleeding is due to hormonal replacement therapy, HRT may be decreased/stopped depending upon the condition."
Parkinson'S Disease,"Parkinson’s disease is a common chronic degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. It is a disabling disease of the ageing population and affects mobility and locomotion. It is classified as a movement disorder. The motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease results from progressive damage of dopamine-generating cells of “substantia nigra”, of the basal ganglia, a part of the brain situated below the cerebral cortex and is called the mid-brain.",The three most important symptoms are:,"Parkinson's disease/ Parkinsonian syndrome is caused by a loss of nerve cells in the part of the brain called the substantia nigra. Nerve cells in this part of the brain are responsible for producing a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine acts as a messenger in the nervous system, and helps control and co-ordinate body movements. If these nerve cells become damaged or die, the amount of dopamine in the brain is reduced. This means that the part of the brain controlling movement cannot work so well, which causes movements to become slow and abnormal. The loss of nerve cells is a slow process. The level of dopamine in the brain falls over time. Only when 80% of the nerve cells in the substantia nigra have been lost, will the symptoms of Parkinson's disease appear and gradually become more severe. Most people with Parkinson's disease have idiopathic disease (having no specific known cause). Possible factors associated with the Parkinson's disease are:",Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is essentially a clinical diagnosis from information derived from medical history and neurological examination. There is no imaging or laboratory test that can identify the disease. Brain scans are sometimes used to rule out disorders that could give rise to similar symptoms,"There is no curative treatment for Parkinson’s diseases and related syndromes as their basic cause is uncertain. Symptomatic improvement for motor symptoms includes levodopa (usually combined with a dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor or COMT inhibitor), dopamine agonists and MAO-B inhibitors."
Pericarditis,Pericarditis is an inflammation of the pericardium (the fluid-filled sac surrounding the heart). A characteristic chest pain is often present. It is a common heart disease.,"The most common symptom of acute pericarditis is sharp, stabbing chest pain which radiates to the bottom of scapula on the back, and is relieved by sitting up and bending forward and worsened by lying down (recumbent or supine position) or inspiration (taking a breath in).","The cause of pericarditis is not clear, but is often associated with the infection such as:",Pericarditis is generally ruled out through symptoms and physical examination and recent history.,Most cases of pericarditis are successfully treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs work by reducing the inflammation of the pericardium. They also help in relieving the chest pain.
Pneumonia,"Pneumonia is inflammation (swelling) of tissue in one or both lungs. It is a condition which primarily affects the air sacs of lungs called as alveoli. It is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria and less commonly other microorganisms, certain drugs. As per UNICEF study in 2010, there were about 3.97 lakhs under 5 children died of pneumonia in India.",Common symptoms include:,Pneumonia is primarily due to infections caused by bacteria or viruses and less commonly by fungi and parasites.,Early diagnosis and treatment is  very important for invasive pneumococcal disease.,Rest Simple painkillers (analgesics) like ibuprufen
Poliomyelitis,"The words polio (grey) and myelon (marrow, indicating the spinal cord) are derived from the Greek. It is the effect of poliomyelitis virus on the spinal cord that leads to the classic manifestation of paralysis. Poliomyelitis or poliio is a crippling and potentially deadly infectious disease caused by poliovirus that spreads from person to person invading the brain and spinal cord resulting into paralysis. Humans are the only known reservoir of poliovirus, which is transmitted most frequently by persons having infection.","Up to 95% of all polio infections are asymptomatic. Infected persons without symptoms shed virus in the stool and are able to transmit virus to other.,Approximately 4%–8% of polio infections result into a minor illness without clinical or laboratory evidence of central nervous system invasion. This is known as abortive poliomyelitis, and is characterized by complete recovery in less than a week. Three symptoms observed with this form of poliovirus infection are upper respiratory tract infection (sore throat and fever) ,gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation or diarrhea) and influenza-like illness.,1-2% of polio infections leads to Nonparalytic aseptic meningitis (symptoms of stiffness of the neck, back, and/or legs), usually following several days after the above mentioned symptoms similar to that of minor illness. Increased or abnormal sensations can also occur. Typically these symptoms will last from 2 to 10days, followed by complete recovery.,Fewer than 1% of all polio infections result in flaccid paralysis which is a clinical manifestation characterized by weakness or paralysis and reduced muscle tone  . Paralytic symptoms generally begin 1 to 10 days after minor illness symptoms and progress for 2 to 3 days. Generally, no further paralysis occurs after the temperature returns to normal. Some signs and symptoms can include a loss of superficial reflexes, initially increased deep tendon reflexes and severe muscle aches and spasms in the limbs or back. The illness progresses to flaccid paralysis with diminished deep tendon reflexes, reaches a plateau without change for days to weeks, and is usually asymmetrical. Strength then begins to return. Patients do not experience sensory losses or changes in cognition.,Many persons with paralytic poliomyelitis recover completely and in most cases muscle function returns to some degree. Weakness or paralysis still present 12 months after onset is usually permanent.","Poliomyelitis is caused by infection with a virus called as poliovirus. It colonizes in the gastrointestinal tract specifically the pharynx and intestine. It is highly contagious and spreads through either fecal-oral route , ingestion of contaminated food and water  or oral-oral route.",Viral Isolation,"Because there is no cure for polio, supportive therapy is given to the patient. Supportive care usually consists of treating the symptoms until the patient recovers. It includes medication for polio symptoms, exercise and a balanced diet."
Post Polio Syndrome,"Postpoliomyelitis syndrome (PPS) is characterized by the delayed appearance of new neuromuscular symptoms in patients many years after their acute poliomyelitis paralysis. PPS affects polio survivors years after they recover from their initial polio attack. It is usually 15 years or more but may range up to 30 to 40 years after an acute attack and is observed in approximately 25% to 28% of patients. PPS usually appears as a new weakening of the muscles affected in polio. This weakness progresses in a stepwise fashion, with periods of decline followed by periods of stability.","The main clinical features are new weakness, muscular fatigability, general fatigue, and pain. Cold intolerance, difficulty in swallowing and breathing, sleep disorders, and worsening functional abilities are also seen.","Only those who have been affected by polio can get PPS. Those who had more severe polio and who recovered more function are more likely to be strongly affected by PPS.,Although the cause of PPS is debated, the common theory is that it is the result of the slow weakening of nerve cells in the spinal cord that were damaged by the polio virus. Overworking these weakened neurons over time leads to even more damage, eventually giving rise to PPS. Symptoms of PPS can appear anywhere from 10 to 40 years after initial polio attack. The average time of onset is about 30 years after initial polio attack.,PPS is not an infectious disease- it cannot spread from one person to another. People affected by PPS are not experiencing another attack of the virus which causes polio, and they cannot spread polio to others.","PPS is difficult to diagnose since the symptoms of presentation are usually non-specific. Predominantly, it is diagnosed by exclusion. Your doctor will confirm your diagnosis by ruling out other illnesses and checking to see if you have:","Although there is no specific treatment for PPS, an interdisciplinary management program can be useful in controlling symptoms. The effectiveness of pharmacological treatment and rehabilitation management in PPS is not yet established. Results indicate that IVIG, lamotrigine, muscle strengthening exercises and static magnetic ﬁelds may be beneﬁcial but need further investigation. The focus should be on a multidisciplinary approach with provision of appropriate exercise regimens and suitable medical or orthotic support."
Papilloedema,,Papilloedema may be asymptomatic and is found on routine examination of the eyes.,Raised intracranial pressure may be caused by:,"A patient should be evaluated for neurologic diseases, febrile illness and malignant hypertension. Record visual acuity, check for colour vision and pupillary reactions to exclude causes of disc oedema. Examination of ocular movements is important to exclude false localising sign due to sixth nerve palsy.",It depends upon the underlying pathological process. It may include:
Pterygium,"A pterygium (plural is pterygia) is a wing like triangular sheet of fibro-vascular tissue which originates in peri-limbal conjunctiva within the palpebral fissure (opening of the eyes between the eyelids) with progressive involvement of the cornea. The lesion involves nasal side of limbus (junction between cornea and conjunctiva) more frequently as compared to temporal limbus. Rarely, it affects the temporal limbus alone.",Patients with pterygium may be asymptomatic or may present with following symptoms in eyes:,Cause for pterygium is not known.,,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Pharyngoconjunctival Fever,"Pharyngoconjunctival Fever (PCF) is an acute and highly infectious adenoviral disease characterised by fever, pharyngitis, acute follicular conjunctivitis and regional lymphoid hyperplasia with tender, enlarged pre-auricular lymphadenopathy.",Paryngoconjunctival fever is characterised by:,Causative adenoviruses consist of a group of morphologically similar but antigenically distinct deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viruses which share a common complement-fixing antigen. Extremely stable adenovirus is present throughout the world and cause infections of the upper respiratory tract and eye.,Diagnosis generally depends upon the history of presentation and physical features of the disease.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (Pcos),"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common hormonal disorders among women of reproductive age. PCOS is common diagnosis in women presenting with infertility.   The exact prevalence of PCOS is not known as the syndrome is not defined precisely. Prevalence of PCOS is highly variable ranging from 2.2% to 26% globally. In few Asian countries prevalence figures are ranging from 2% to 7.5% in China and 6.3% in Srilanka. There are few studies conducted in India. Studies done in South India and Maharashtra, prevalence of PCOS (by Rotterdam's criteria) were reported as 9.13% and 22.5% (10.7% by Androgen Excess Society criteria) respectively.",PCOS is a syndrome disease defined by a group of signs (physical findings) and symptoms (patient complaints).Symptoms can vary from woman to woman. Some of the symptoms of PCOS include:,"The cause of PCOS is unknown. But most experts think that several factors, including genetics, could play a role. Women with PCOS are more likely to have a mother or sister with PCOS.",There are different criteria for diagnosis of PCOS –,"Treatment of PCOS is not curative. Treatment focuses on controlling symptoms and managing the condition to prevent complications. The treatment will vary from woman to woman, depending on specific symptoms. Life style modifications consisting of a healthy diet and regular exercise are recommended for all women with PCOS, particularly those who are overweight."
Perennial Allergic Conjunctivitis,"Perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC) is an inflammatory response of the conjunctiva triggered by exposure to allergens such as pollens, animal dander (flecks of dead skin cells and hair/feathers) and other environmental antigens. Intermittent (less than 4 weeks in duration) seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC) and persistent (more than 4 weeks in duration) perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), makes up a large number of ocular (eye) allergy cases.",Symptoms of PAC and SAC are essentially similar and typically develop on a gradual basis but can also develop suddenly following contact with the offending allergen.,Perennial allergic conjunctivitis is less common than SAC and tends to be milder than the seasonal form.,Diagnosis of PAC is generally based on clinical history and careful slit-lamp (bio-microscopic) examination by an eye-specialist.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Phlyctenular Keratoconjunctivitis,"Phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis (PKC), Phlyctenular conjunctivitis, Phlyctenulosis or phlyctenular eye disease (PED) is an endogenous type IV delayed hypersensitivity (T cell-mediated) allergic reaction to an antigen. It is an inflammatory condition which causes marked photophobia and mucopurulent discharge. PKC is characterised by sub-epithelial, single or multiple, gray-white, raised conjunctival or corneal nodules, generally at or near the limbus, surrounded by a zone of engorged hyperaemic vessels.",PKC produces symptoms like:,"Phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis is an endogenous non-infectious inflammatory type IV delayed hypersensitivity (T cell-mediated) allergic reaction to an antigen. The disease is common in malnourished and debilitated children between five and twelve years of age. These children may suffer from enlarged tonsils, adenoids and cervical lymphadenopathy.","Clinical signs may vary slightly according to the specific causative organism. It may occur either unilaterally or bilaterally in the conjunctiva, cornea or at limbus. The presence of phlycten on the palpebral conjunctiva is a rarity. Phlyctenulosis may also be an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients with a recent history of bacterial, parasitic, or fungal infection.",Management should be carried out under medical supervision only.
Plague,"Plague is a communicable disease, caused by bacterium Yersinia pestis. It is one of the oldest diseases known to man and still occurs in the tropics, subtropics and warmer areas of temperate countries. Past outbreaks have shown that plague may reoccur in areas that have long remained silent.","Incubation period (time taken between catching an infection and appearance of symptoms) of the disease is 3-7 days. Disease starts with flu like symptoms such as sudden onset of fever, chills, head and body-aches and weakness, vomiting and nausea.","Plague is caused by Yersinia pestis (non-motile, non-acid fast, non spore forming, gram-negative cocco-bacillus). Y. pestis is easily destroyed by sunlight, high temperatures, and disinfectants.","When plague is suspected, clinical specimens should be collected immediately and specific antimicrobial treatment should be started before confirmation of laboratory diagnosis. Routine diagnostic specimens for smear and culture include the following: whole blood; aspirates from suspected buboes; pharyngeal swabs, sputum samples or tracheal washes (from those with suspected plague pharyngitis or pneumonia); and cerebrospinal fluid (from those with suspected meningitis).",As the disease is fatal early diagnosis and treatment is essential for the good prognosis of the patient.
Pinguecula,"Pinguecula (derived from Latin word pinguis, which means fat) represents an area of bulbar conjunctival thickening adjoining limbus in the palpebral fissure area. Pinguecula are less transparent than normal conjunctiva and often have a fatty appearance. They are usually bilateral, triangular, elevated, white to yellow in colour, horizontally oriented, and are located nasally much more often than temporally. They may also present on both the nasal and temporal conjunctiva in the eyes of some patients. Pinguecula does not cross the limbus, and current information suggests that pinguecula does not progress to pterygium and that the two are distinct disorders.",Pinguecula are usually asymptomatic.,The causes of pinguecula are not known with certainty.,The diagnosis is usually clinical and may require slit-lamp biomicroscopy.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Preterm Birth,"Preterm birth (premature birth) is a significant public health problem across the world because of associated neonatal (first 28 days of life) mortality and short- and long-term morbidity and disability in later life. Preterm is defined by World Health Organization (WHO) as babies born alive before 37 completed weeks of gestation or fewer than 259 days of gestation since the first day of a woman’s last menstrual period (LMP). Normally, a pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks.","Preterm is defined as babies born alive before 37 weeks of pregnancy or fewer than 259 days of gestation are completed since the first day of a woman’s last menstrual period (LMP). There are sub-categories of preterm birth, based on gestational age:",Preterm birth is a syndrome with a variety of causes which can be classified into two broad subtypes:,"To date, there is no single test or sequence of assessment measures to accurately predict preterm birth. Clinical, biophysical, and biochemical tests that can be used as predictors for preterm birth are:",Management of preterm birth incorporates the specialized care of women during pregnancy and child birth along with care of newborn (preterm) baby.
Preeclampsia,Preeclampsia is one of the hypertensive (high blood pressure) disorders of pregnancy. It is a major cause of maternal and perinatal mortality (number of stillbirths and deaths of newborn in the first week of life) and morbidity.,"Although pathophysiological changes (e.g. inadequate placentation) exist from very early stages of the pregnancy, hypertension and proteinuria usually become apparent in the second half of pregnancy.",Causes-,Diagnostic criteria for Preeclampsia (ACOG):,"Management of pregnant women with preeclampsia without severe features aims with first consideration of safety of women and her foetus and second with delivery of a mature newborn that will not require intensive or prolonged neonatal care. It depends on the results of maternal and fetal evaluation, gestational age, presence of labour, or rupture of membranes, vaginal bleeding and wishes of the women."
Pellucid Marginal Degeneration,"Pellucid marginal degeneration (PMD) is a bilateral (may be asymmetric), progressive, inferior crescentic peripheral thinning of the cornea. There is no vascularisation, infiltration or scarring in the area of involved cornea. Band of thinning measures about 1 to 2mm in width and extends from 4 to 8 o’clock position (about 6 to 8mm), leaving a normal band of 1 to 2mm from the limbus. The condition affects both men and women between 20 to 40 years of age. The condition results in high irregular astigmatism and rarely may develop acute hydrops (stromal oedema due to leakage of aqueous humour through breaks in Descemet’s membrane) or even perforation. It differs from keratoconus in that it has no iron ring, its thinning is in inferior part without a cone; and the corneal protrusion is located above (rather than) in the area of thinning. Pellucid marginal degeneration and keratoconus may exist in the same eye and in different eyes of the same patient. This association in the same patient suggests that pellucid marginal degeneration, keratoconus and keratoglobus (generalised thinning and globular protrusion of the cornea) may be varying spectrum of the same pathophysiology rather than separate disease processes. The central cornea is usually of normal thickness, and the epithelium overlying the area of thinning is intact. Rarely, it may involve superior part of cornea.",Pellucid marginal degeneration is usually asymptomatic except for visual deterioration.,"The exact cause of pellucid marginal degeneration is not clear and it is not known whether PMD, keratoconus, and keratoglobus are distinct diseases or phenotypic variations of the same disorder. Due to the concomitant presence of PMD with keratoconus in the same eye, many have proposed that PMD is a peripheral form of keratoconus.","Diagnosis depends upon history, slit-lamp examination, pachymetry (measures thickness of the cornea) and corneal topography.",Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Presbyopia,Presbyopia is the gradual age- related loss of accommodative amplitude which begins early in life and culminates in complete loss of accommodation by about 50 years of age. The word presbyopia is derived from the Greek words presbus (meaning old man) and ops (eye).,"Patients with latent hypermetropia (far- sightedness) use a portion of their accommodative reserve to focus at distance, and may present with premature presbyopia. Mild myopia (short- sightedness), in contrast, may have delayed onset of symptoms of presbyopia.",Presbyopia is caused due to loss of the fine balance of forces that permit the accommodative structures to bring a change in optical power of the lens in the young eye.,Diagnosing presbyopia is straightforward and age of the patient is a major consideration. A simple reading test using well- illuminated text of graded sizes at a standard distance may be helpful both in characterising the degree of near- vision and in determining the appropriate refractive power.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Premenstrual Syndrome,Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common health problem in women in reproductive age.PMS refers to the changes in female’s mood along with certain physical symptoms relating to her menstrual cycle that are significant enough to affect her quality of life.,"Symptoms of PMS have been reported to affect as many as 90% of women of reproductive age, sometime during their lives. Symptoms occur during the two weeks before a woman's period starts, known as the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The symptoms typically become more intense in the two to three days prior to the period and usually resolve after the first day or two of flow. Symptoms vary from woman to woman. Symptoms may occur in the form of following changes-","The definitive cause of PMS is unknown, however following etiologies are postulated based on recent research such as-","Diagnosis of PMS is done clinically according to symptoms and by ruling out other conditions having similar symptoms such as depression, anxiety, peri-menopause, chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, thyroid disease. Depression and anxiety disorders are the most common conditions that overlap with PMS however; in these conditions symptoms are present all month long and may worsen before or during the periods.","If symptoms of PMS are mild to moderate, they can be relieved by life style changes that mainly include healthy diet and exercise. Behavioral counseling and stress management may help the patients regain control during times of high emotional disturbances."
Pseudophakia,Pseudophakia refers to the presence of an intraocular lens (IOL) implant. The IOL may be inserted at the time of cataract surgery for the removal of crystalline lens or it may be put as a secondary procedure to correct aphakia. The IOL may be placed in the anterior chamber (anterior-chamber IOL) or posterior chamber (posterior-chamber IOL).,Pseudophakia patients are generally asymptomatic.,Pseudophakia is the condition being produced by implantation of an intraocular lens in the eye.,Diagnosis depends upon,Usually no management is required in pseudophakia.
Pseudostrabismus,"Pseudostrabismus gives an appearance of strabismus (squint) when no manifest deviation of the visual axis is actually present. This apparent misalignment of the eyes is created by certain morphological features of the face, although it may be associated with certain ocular or orbital conditions. The most common form of pseudostrabismus is pseudoesotropia where the eyes appear crossed. There may be pseudoexotropia, where eyes appear to be deviated outwards and pseudohypertropia where eyes appear to be misaligned vertically.","Usually parents notice squint in the eyes of young child. The deviation is more noticeable when the child turns head and the eyes are in lateral gaze, especially in pseudoesotropia because nasal sclera appears buried in the epicanthal fold.",I. Pseudoesotropia: Pseudoesotropia is the most common type of pseudostrabismus and may be seen due to,Clinical diagnosis of pseudostrabismus requires ruling out the presence of true intermittent or constant strabismus.,Orthoptic investigation establishes the presence of binocular single vision and fusion control in cases of pseudostrabismus.
Puerperal Sepsis,Puerperal sepsis,"Puerperal sepsis was defined as infection of the genital tract occurring at any time between the onset of rupture of membranes or labour, and the 42nd day postpartum in which two or more of the following symptoms and signs may be present-","Puerperal sepsis is bacterial infection of the genital tract which occurs after the birth of a baby. Some of the most common bacteria causing puerperal sepsis are streptococci, staphylococci, escherichia coli (E.coli), clostridium tetani, clostridium welchii, chlamydia and gonococci (bacteria which cause sexually transmitted diseases). More than one type of bacteria may be involved in puerperal sepsis. Bacteria may be either nosocomial, endogenous or exogenous.","General history and clinical examination of women after child birth are important steps in assessing the post partum complications. Vital signs such as temperature, pulse, respiration, blood pressure, and examination of breast, abdomen, perineum, legs; lochia (discharge after child birth) should be examined carefully.","The objective of management in puerperal sepsis is to make an early diagnosis, treat, prevent complications, and consequently to improve quality of life."
Postpartum Haemorrhage,"Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is a complication of delivery and the most common cause of maternal death, accounting for about 35% of all maternal deaths worldwide. These deaths have a major impact on the lives and health of the families affected.",The usual presentation of PPH is one of heavy vaginal bleeding that can quickly lead to signs and symptoms of hypovolemic shock.,"Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) may result from various reasons such as failure of the uterus to contract adequately (atony), genital tract trauma (vaginal or cervical lacerations), uterine rupture, retained placental tissue, or maternal bleeding disorders.","Diagnosis of PPH is usually performed by closely observing the pregnant women during child birth and afterwards. After childbirth, blood loss and other clinical parameters should be closely monitored. When estimating the percentage of blood loss, consideration should be given to body weight and the original haemoglobin level (PPH may be aggravated by pre-existing anaemia).","As the majority of women who experience PPH complications have no identifiable clinical risk factors, it is recommended that active management of the third stage of labour (AMTSL) be offered to all women during childbirth, whenever a skilled provider is assisting with the delivery."
Photophthalmia,Photophthalmia is produced due to exposure to short wavelength ultraviolet (UV) rays (especially in wavelength range of 311- 290 nanometer). The cornea absorbs ultraviolet radiation. This may be associated with,Symptoms of photophthalmia usually manifest with a latent period of about 4- 5 hours after exposure to ultraviolet rays. It includes,Photophthalmia may be caused due to exposure to short wavelength,Diagnosis depends upon the clinical history and signs observed on examination.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Post-Herpetic Neuralgia,"Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is defined as a chronic neuropathic pain that persists for three or more months following acute Herpes zoster (shingles) infection. It is a severe painful secondary phase, which may develop three to six months after the resolution of initial phase of Herpes zoster (HZ) infection. Pain has a dermatomal distribution and is confined to same dermatome as the rash. Herpes zoster infection results from activation of the varicella zoster virus (VZV) which remains latent in dorsal root ganglia since the first infection of chickenpox (varicella). Pain frequently precedes Herpes zoster infection (pre-herpetic neuralgia), and outlasts the herpetic rash by some weeks. It is more common in older individuals (develops in up to 75% of patients over 70 years of age) and is less common in individuals younger than fifty years of age.","The crusts of Herpes zoster falls away on healing, and leave pink scars in the distribution of rashes. The scars gradually become hypo-pigmented and atrophic.",Risk factors for developing PHN are,The diagnosis of PHN is by clinical examination in most of the patients.,Management
Postpartum Depression/ Perinatal Depression,Postpartum depression (PPD) is depression that occurs to a mother after a childbirth. PPD is defined as an episode of non-psychotic depression with onset within 1 year of childbirth. PPD can happen any time after childbirth. It often starts within 1 to 3 weeks after a childbirth and may last for weeks or months at a time.,"The patterns of symptoms in women with postpartum depression are similar to those in women who have depression unrelated to childbirth, apart from the fact that the content may focus on the delivery or baby.",Postpartum depression probably is caused by a combination of factors. These factors include the following:,"A health care provider can diagnose a woman with postpartum depression. Because symptoms of this condition are broad and may vary between women, a health care provider can help a woman figure out whether the symptoms she is feeling are due to postpartum depression or something else. A woman who experiences any of these symptoms should see a health care provider right away.",Many options are there for managing PPD during pregnancy or after birth. Some women may participate in counseling (talk therapy); and others may need medication. There is no single treatment that works for everyone.
Q Fever,"Q fever is a bacterial infection caused by the coxiella burnetii bacteria. It causes flu-like symptoms such as a high temperature, muscle pain and headaches. The infection results from inhalation of a spore-like small cell variant, and from contact with the milk, urine, feces, vaginal mucus, or semen of infected animals. Rarely, the disease is also known as tick borne.,The ‘Q’ in Q fever stands for ‘query’. This is because when the infection was first indentified, its cause was unknown. The cause is now understood but the name has remained the sames.",Incubation period is usually two to three weeks. The most common manifestation is mild flu-like symptoms with:,"Q fever is caused by bacteria known as coxiella burnetii (or c. burnetii). This bacteria generally spreads by animals infected by the bacteria.,The most commonly affected animals, and those that pose the biggest risk to humans, are:","Q fever can be diagnosed using a blood test.,Blood test: If the c. burnetii bacteria that cause Q fever is present in blood, then immune system (the body’s natural defence system) will produce a type of protein called an antibody to kill them.",Antibiotics can be used for Q fever like doxycycline or tetracycline.
Quinsy,It is also known as peritonsillar abscess. It is collection of pus into tonsils and Peritonsilar space. The abscess (collection of pus) forms between one of tonsils and the wall of throat. This can happen when an infection spreads from an infected tonsil to the surrounding area.,Symptoms of quinsy can include:,"Peri Tonsillar Abscess is usually a complication of an untreated or partially treated acute tonsillitis. The infection, in these cases, spreads to the peritonsillar area (peritonsillitis). This region comprises loose connective tissue and is hence susceptible to formation of abscess.",The doctor may ask about symptoms and examine throat and tonsils,"Antibiotics are given to treat the infection. If the person is allergic to penicillin, clindamycin is generally administered."
Rabies,"Rabies is a fatal viral infection that targets the brain and nervous system. The disease is zoonotic i.e. it can be transmitted from one species to another, such as from dogs to humans, commonly following a bite from an infected animal. For a human, rabies is almost always fatal if post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is not administered immediately following an exposure. The rabies virus infects the central nervous system, ultimately affecting the brain and resulting in death. The rabies virus travels to the brain through the peripheral nerves. The incubation period of the disease i.e. the time lag between the bite/exposure to rabies and onset of symptoms of the disease, is usually about a few days to few months in humans, depending on the site and severity of exposure, the   distance the virus must travel to reach the central nervous system and other factors.",The period between infection and the first flu-like symptoms is typically 2 to 12 weeks.  Initially the symptoms usually include one or more of the following:,"The rabies virus belongs to a group of viruses called lyssaviruses, which can infect mammals. The virus is present in the saliva of rabid animal.",The primary diagnosis of rabies depends on clinical presentation and history of exposure to a suspect rabid animal or rabies virus (RABV).,"Treatment depends upon the whether the patient has started to show any signs and symptoms. Once clinical symptoms appear, rabies is 100% fatal. Presently the treatment involves providing life-supporting services in intensive care facilities and other palliative measures."
Raynaud'S Phenomenon,"It is a vasospastic disorder causing discoloration of the fingers, toes and occasionally other areas. It is a condition that leads to brittle nails with longitudinal ridges. Raynaud's phenomenon includes Raynaud's disease (also known as ""Primary Raynaud's phenomenon"") where the phenomenon is idiopathic.","The condition can cause pain within the affected extremities, discoloration (paleness), and sensations of cold and numbness. These changes to the skin usually happen in three stages:","Raynaud's phenomenon is the result of over-sensitive blood vessels in the body's extremities. In many cases, no cause is identified, although it is sometimes linked to other health conditions.","Medical history taking by physician will often reveal whether the condition is primary or secondary. Once it is established, an examination is largely to identify possible secondary causes of Raynaud's phenomenon.",It is mainly managed by managing the trigger factors in case of primary Raynaud's. Secondary Raynaud's can be treated by treating its underlying courses.
Rubella,"Rubella (also known as german measles) is a viral infection that used to be common in children. Rubella is usually a mild infection. It can be fatal usually with minimal systemic upset although transient arthropathy may occur in adults. Serious complications such as deterioration of the skin is very rare. Apart from the effects of transplacental infection on the developing fetus, rubella is a relatively trivial infection.",Incubation period is for 2-3 weeks. Symptoms include:,Rubella is caused by the rubella virus (toga virus). The virus is spread through air by droplets from infected person to uninfected person.,Blood test:,Symptomatic treatment is generally provided. Ibuprofen/ paracetamol are generally administered to relieve pain and fever. Patients are advised to drink plenty of fluids.
Retinopathy Of Prematurity,"Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), previously called retrolental fibroplasia, is a vaso-proliferative retinopathy which affects premature infants exposed to high concentration of oxygen. Retinopathy of prematurity often regresses but has the potential of causing visual impairment or blindness. ROP causes disorganised growth of retinal blood vessels which may lead to retinal scarring or even detachment of retina.",,"Retinopathy of prematurity occurs in pre-term infants born before the normal growth of retinal blood vessels. Like other retinopathies, local ischaemia of retina plays a role in ROP.",Diagnosis depends on the history of development and the clinical features.,The infant should be managed under medical supervision.
Recurrent Corneal Erosion Syndrome,"Recurrent Corneal Erosion Syndrome (RCES), a corneal epithelial adhesion disorder, is a painful, often frightening, and sometimes incapacitating condition of the cornea. Corneal epithelial cells undergo erosions and results in denuded areas on the corneal surface. These areas then re-epithelise, the process recurs and the epithelial cells slough again. With many patients, erosions are characteristically episodic in nature.","Patients with RCES may experience ocular (eye) symptoms (may be triggered by a trivial mechanical trauma), typically on awakening, such as:",RCES may be associated with trauma or anterior corneal dystrophies.,"Patients of RCES develop pain, watering, redness and photophobia that may vary from mild to severe. Some present with disease every day, but others have recurrences that may vary from every week or month to longer periods of time without any symptoms. Typically, pain is more severe at night or upon waking in the morning and may be related to REM during sleep or on opening of the eyelid. Patients are usually aware of this and they try to open the eyes gently every morning, but others refer that they are awakened in the middle of the night because of the pain. In acute phase of the disease, corneal erosion is always present, commonly in the lower half of the cornea, irrespective of the aetiology. This area of the cornea is in permanent contact with the tear film and lower lid and is most exposed to the evaporative dry eye disease.",Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Rheumatic Fever And Rheumatic Heart Disease,"Rheumatic fever (RF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) are major public health problems among children and young adults in developing countries; though RF/RHD has declined in developed countries. Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is an illness caused by an immunological reaction to infection with the bacterium group A streptococcus (GAS). RF affects connective tissues, and may result in rheumatic heart disease which may progress to heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and embolic stroke.","Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is preceded by sore throat. Sore throats are caused by a variety of bacteria and viruses and commonly affect all age groups; however, important symptoms and signs of Streptococcus sore throat are-","Rheumatic fever is caused by the immune system overreacting to the presence of group A streptococcus bacteria. During infection the immune system fights the infection by producing antibodies to proteins on the surface of the bacteria. In certain strains of group A streptococcal bacteria, the proteins on the bacteria appear similar to proteins in the human cells and the immune system begins to attack human cells with similar proteins such as heart, joints, skin.",There is currently no single test to diagnose acute rheumatic fever (ARF). Diagnosis is based on clinical assessment and the identification of a number of signs and symptoms that are associated with the illness. Signs and symptoms of ARF are divided into two categories: major and minor.,Management of Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is based on treating infection and relieving symptoms. This includes:
Ramsay-Hunt Syndrome,"Ramsay-Hunt Syndrome or Herpes zoster oticus is a syndrome characterised by acute otalgia, herpetic vesicular rash associated with facial palsy. This is the second most common cause of facial paralysis and is due to reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus that remains dormant/latent in the geniculate ganglion after primary infection with chickenpox. Characteristic presentation is severe acute otalgia with unilateral facial paralysis. Vesicular eruptions if not present initially, may appear usually within three to five days. The vesicles may appear on post-auricular skin, pinna, concha, ear canal, and tympanic membrane. Occasionally it may affect neck, shoulder or oral cavity. Besides facial nerve, it may affect other cranial nerves as well.","Commonly, Ramsay Hunt syndrome is a disease affecting elderly people or someone with immune deficiency. However, it may be seen in younger patients under conditions of stress.",Ramsay Hunt syndrome is caused due to reactivation of Varicella zoster virus (VZV) lying dormant in geniculate ganglion.,"Diagnosis of Ramsay Hunt syndrome is based upon the clinical history of otalgia associated with vesicular lesions or eschars, and facial paralysis.",Management includes
Rare Diseases,"Rare diseases are often serious, chronic and life-threatening conditions. WHO defines a rare disease as often debilitating lifelong disease or disorder with a prevalence of 1 or less, per 1000 population. However, different countries have their definitions to suit their specific requirements and in the context of their population, the health care system and resources.",,Causes,"Early diagnosis of rare diseases is a challenge because of multiple factors that include lack of awareness among primary care physicians, lack of adequate screening and diagnostic facilities.","About 95% of rare diseases have no approved treatment even when a correct diagnosis is made. Where drugs are available, they are quite expensive as very few pharmaceutical companies globally manufacture drugs for rare diseases. For this reason, rare diseases are also called ‘orphan diseases’ and drugs to treat them are called “orphan drugs."
Reiter’S Syndrome,"Reiter’s Syndrome/Disease) is an asymmetric polyarthritis which affect large joints of the lower extremities, small joints of the feet and axial skeleton (spondylitis). Reactive arthritis (ReA) is characterised by a triad of arthritis, urethritis, and conjunctivitis. It may be accompanied by mucocutaneous lesions. This disease is more common in males with an age of onset of about 15 to 35 years.",General systemic symptoms,The Cause of ReA appears to be,Diagnosis depends upon clinical examination and investigations.,"Management involves joint protection, maintenance of function, suppression of inflammation, patient education, pain relief, and eradication of infection where indicated."
Sarcoidosis,"Sarcoidosis is characterized by the presence of collections of inflammatory cells (granulomas). The disease primarily affects the lungs, but granulomas can also form in the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, eyes, and skin, and less often in the spleen, bones, joints, sinuses, skeletal muscles, kidneys, heart, reproductive organs, salivary glands, and nervous system. The granulomas may eventually disappear completely or become scar tissue.",Symptoms of sarcoidosis vary depending upon the organ affected:,"The exact cause of sarcoidosis is not known. There may genetic predisposition to developing the disease, which may be triggered by exposure to specific bacteria, viruses, dust or chemicals.",A physical exam may show the following:,"Medicinal: Steroids are generally prescribed to keep inflammation under control.,Surgery: Organ transplant may be considered if sarcoidosis has severely damaged lungs or liver."
Sarcoma,"Sarcoma is a cancer that arises from cells of mesenchymal  origin . Malignant tumors made of cancellous  bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, vascular, or hematopoietic tissues are considered sarcomas. There are three main types of sarcoma: soft tissue sarcoma, bone arcoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) and 100 sub types of sarcoma.","The most common symptom of bone cancer is bone pain. It generally begins with a feeling of tenderness in the affected bone, and then gradually progresses to a persistent ache that often feels worse during the night or while using the affected bone. Others symptoms of bone cancer include:",Cancer generally begins with the change in the DNA structure known as mutations.,X-rays: X-rays can often detect damage to the bones that is caused by cancer or any new bone that's growing because of cancer.,Chemotherapy: It is generally done to shrink the size of tumor and to treat any cancerous cells that may have spread.
Schizophrenia,Schizophrenia is a long-term mental health condition that causes a range of different psychological symptoms.,Changes in thinking and behavior are the most characteristic signs of schizophrenia. These include:,"The exact cause  of schizophrenia is unknown. It is suggested that a combination of physical, genetic, psychological and environmental factors can make people more likely to develop the condition.",No tests are available.Generally diagnosis is based on presenting symptoms  .,"The treatment of schizophrenia is with antipsychotic medications, often combined with psychological and social support  ."
Scurvy,"Scurvy is a medical condition that can develops due to deficiency of vitamin C in diet. Vitamin C (also called ascorbic acid) is vital for the body as it is needed to make collagen. Collagen is a type of protein found in many different types of tissue, such as skin, blood vessels, bones and cartilage (which covers the surface of joints). Without vitamin C, collagen can't be replaced and the different types of tissue break down.",,"Scurvy is caused by a lack of vitamin C in diet. There are usually other contributing factors, such as:",Scurvy can be diagnosed through the symptomatic approach.,
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars),"It is a viral respiratory disease in humans which is caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). It is a severe, life threatening form of pneumonia. SARS originated in the Guangdong province of southern China in 2002. The infection quickly spread to other countries (a pandemic), and resulted in more than 8,000 cases and 774 deaths before the virus was eventually brought under control.",SARS has flu-like symptoms that usually begins after incubation period of 2-10 days. They include:,"Coronaviruses are positive-strand, enveloped RNA viruses that are important pathogens of mammals and birds. This group of viruses cause enteric or respiratory tract infections in a variety of animals, including humans, livestock, and pets.","Polymerase chain reaction (PCR): It can detect genetic material of the SARS-CoV in various specimens like blood, stool, respiratory secretions or body tissues Sampling for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) diagnostic tests.",Treatment is mainly supportive and may include:
Swine Flu,,Swine flu has an incubation period (the time taken for the symptoms to appear) of 1-4 days. Its symptoms are similar to influenza (flu). These include:,"Swine flu is caused by virus called H1N1 virus. This virus infects the wind pipe (respiratory tract) of pigs and later it gets transmitted to human beings. It results in nasal secretions, cough, decreased appetite, and restless behavior.",Swine flu can be diagnosed clinically by the patient's history and their symptoms. The diagnosis may further confirmed in the laboratory through a technique called RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction).,"Two antiviral agents are helpful in preventing or reducing the effects of swine flu. They are zanamivir (Relenza) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu). Both are also used to prevent or reduce influenza A and B symptoms.,These drugs should not be used indiscriminately i.e. without the doctor’s prescription. Because it can lead to ineffectiveness of the drug due to viral resistance."
Syphilis,"Syphilis is sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the spirochete bacterium Treponema pallidum. This disease can be passed to another person through kissing or close physical contact. The infected person is often unaware of the disease and unknowingly passes it on to his or her sexual partner.,The sexual behaviour  that spreads syphilis can also spread other Sexually transmitted diseases(STD's) like gonorrhea, HIVs.",The symptoms of syphilis are the same for men and women. Also symptoms are mild and thus can be difficult to recognize.,"Syphilis is caused by the bacteria Treponema pallidum.,The bacteria can enter one's body if he/she have close contact with an infected sore, normally during vaginal, anal or oral sex or by sharing sex toys.,Reference:,http://www.niaid.nih.gov",Physical examination:,"Penicillin, an antibiotic, injected into the muscle, is the best treatment for syphilis. If someone is allergic to penicillin, then healthcare provider may give another antibiotic to take by mouth."
Superior Limbic Keratoconjunctivitis,"Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis (SLK) is relatively an uncommon chronic disease of superior limbus/cornea, and superior bulbar and tarsal conjunctiva. It affects one or both eyes of middle-aged people, about half the patients have abnormal thyroid function (usually hyperthyroidism). About three percent of patients with thyroid eye disease develop SLK. Women are more commonly affected than men.",The characteristic feature of the symptoms of SLK is its variability with intermittent remissions and exacerbations.,Soft contact lens wear may be associated with features like SLK.  It may be attributable to preservatives especially thiomersal. Removal of lens or preservatives is usually curative.,"History of contact lens wear, and previous eyelid surgery or trauma should be obtained from the patient.",Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Stroke,"Stroke (also known as Brain Attack) occurs when blood supply to the  brain is affected due to either blockage or leakage (or both blockage and leakage)  of a blood vessel responsible for supplying or draining blood to and from  the brain, thereby, causing brain damage leading to difficulty in movements, sensation, speaking, vision etc. or at times to death.","Stroke can affect any movement, senses, speech, behavior, thoughts, memory, and emotions. The body may become paralyzed or weak.",Presence of following risk factors place people at increased risk for developing stroke.,"Strokes is primarily a clinical diagnosis, supported by  brain imaging.","All patients need good supportive care in a stroke unit, looked after by physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, Speech therapists, Occupational therapists with help from Radiologists, Neurosurgeons and others with interest in stroke."
Scrub Typhus,Scrub typhus,"A Papule develops at the site of bite. Bites are often found on the groin, axillae, genitalia or neck.  The papule ulcerates and eventually heals with development of a black eschar.",Scrub typhus is caused by a bacterium called Orientia tsutsugamushi. Infection is transmitted by the mite Leptotrombidium deliense.,"Scrub typhus commonly presents as an undifferentiated fever that requires laboratory confirmation for the diagnosis,","Scrub typhus is treated with antibiotics. Treatment to be given will depend on the age of patient, pregnancy status of female patient."
Sexually Transmitted Infections (Stis),Sexually transmitted infections (STIs),"The majority of STIs are present without symptoms. A person can have an STI without having obvious symptoms of disease. Therefore, the term “sexually transmitted infection” a broader term than “sexually transmitted disease” (STD) is preferred.","STIs are caused by more than 30 different bacteria, viruses and parasites. The major STIs and their causes are:",Accurate diagnostic tests for STIs are widely used in high-income countries. These are especially useful for the diagnosis of asymptomatic infections.,STI case management is the care of a person with an STI-related syndrome or with a positive test for one or more STIs.
Shaken Baby Syndrome,"Shaken baby syndrome (SBS) is a violent act of one form of child abuse, a non-accidental traumatic brain injury, which can cause neurologic, cognitive and other functional deficits. Retinal findings may be the only manifestation of SBS and then an eye specialist may initially recognise it. Cases should be thoroughly reviewed and prevention strategies developed to prevent further incidents. SBS has important medico-legal implications since the safety of child may be at stake.",SBS victims may present with a wide variety of symptoms ranging from very mild to most critical of states.,"Head injuries are the chief cause of traumatic death and leading cause of fatalities due to child abuse. Serious injuries in infants, notably those causing death, are rarely accidental unless there is a clear cause for the injuries, such as road traffic accident due to motor vehicle.","The onset of symptoms is useful both in understanding prognosis as well as determining a cause. Timing can best be established by the history, clinical course and results of diagnostic imaging studies. When accurate, the clinical history is the most precise means for establishing a timeline. Elapsed time from the onset of injury can be estimated through the breakdown of intracranial haemoglobin as seen on diagnostic radiological studies.",Management should be strictly under medical supervision.
Seasonal Allergic Conjunctivitis,"Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC) or ‘hay fever eyes’ is an inflammatory response of the conjunctiva triggered by exposure to seasonal allergens such as pollens, animal dander (flecks of dead skin cells and hair/feathers) and other environmental antigens. Intermittent (less than 4 weeks in duration) seasonal allergic conjunctivitis and persistent (more than 4 weeks in duration) perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), makes up a large number of ocular (eye) allergy cases. Most cases of SAC occur during the spring and autumn when the level of seasonal allergens (i.e. pollens) is high. In contrast, PAC generally occurs in response to environmental allergens (dust mites and animal dander) that are present throughout the year and is generally chronic. Majority of PAC and SAC affect both young and middle-aged people of both sexes.",Ocular symptoms associated with SAC may be:,"Acute allergy is caused by IgE-mediated MC degranulation, whereas chronic allergies are also associated with continuous activation of MC but with predominance of mediators, such as eosinophils and T- helper2 (Th2) lymphocyte-generated cytokines.",Diagnosis of SAC is generally based on clinical history and careful slit-lamp (bio-microscopic) examination by an eye-specialist.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Spheroidal Degeneration,"Spheroidal degeneration (climatic droplet keratopathy, Bietti’s band-shaped nodular dystrophy, chronic actinic keratopathy or Labrador keratopathy) is a nonhereditary acquired degenerative condition of the eye. Spheroidal degeneration is characterised by sub-epithelial accumulation of spherical opalescent droplets that coalesce to form bands or nodules with elevated corneal epithelium. The degenerative process is mainly seen in the inter-palpebral part of the cornea.","Spheroidal degeneration is asymptomatic in majority of the cases. Visual acuity may be affected if the deposits extend towards the center of the cornea, thereby, blocking the visual axis.",The exact cause of spheroidal degeneration is not known. It is hypothesized to be due to:,Diagnosis depends upon:,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Salzmann'S Nodular Degeneration,"Salzmann’s Nodular Degeneration is a non-inflammatory, degenerative process characterised by whitish-grey or bluish-white elevated sub-epithelial nodules in the superficial corneal stroma that are usually bilateral, mid-peripheral and slowly progressive. There is usually a clear area before the limbus. It can cause blurred vision if it occurs in central part blocking the visual axis. It occurs more often in women than in men. The nodules elevate the epithelium. Peripheral lesions tend to be vascularised and may look like pseudopterygium.",Many patients with Salzmann’s nodular degeneration are asymptomatic.,"Though the aetiology remains uncertain in majority of the cases, it is hypothesized that Salzmann’s nodular degeneration can be triggered by multiple events that lead to a nonspecific corneal tissue reaction based on individual predisposition. It appears to be more frequent in middle-aged women, and may be bilateral in about 60% of cases.",Diagnosis of Salzmann’s nodular degeneration is usually made clinically.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Spinal Cord Injury,"Spinal cord Injury is a term used to refer the damage to the spinal cord resulting from trauma (such as road accidents) or from disease or degeneration (such as cancer). SCI, with its resultant paralysis is one of the most devastating medical conditions of public health importance.","Symptoms of SCI may include partial or complete loss of sensation and movements of arms, legs and/or body. The most severe spinal cord injury affects the systems that regulate bowel or bladder control, breathing, heart rate and blood pressure.","The spinal cord is made of millions of nerves that carry messages between the brain and all parts of the body such as skin. muscles, organs. It is surrounded by bony rings called vertebrae or vertebral column.","In a trauma case the doctor will check first to make sure the patient has a working airway, proper breathing and pulse. The next step for diagnosing a spinal cord injury is to assess an individual’s neurologic function. A neurological examination includes testing for muscle strength, sensory function and movement in arms and legs/body.","Essential measures for improving the survival, health and prevention from secondary conditions include the following."
Substance Abuse,"Substance abuse refers to the harmful or hazardous use of psychoactive substances, including alcohol and illicit drugs. The use of psychoactive substances causes significant health and social problems for the people who use them, and also for others in their families and communities. Substances of abuse include alcohol, opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, hallucinogens, prescription and over-the-counter drug abuse. (Psychoactive substances are substances that, when taken in or administered into one's system, affect mental processes).","Substance use problems can arise as a result of acute intoxication, regular use or dependence, and from the way in which substances are used. It is possible for a person to have problems from all of these.",Risk factors-,"In response to the overwhelming public health burden associated with psychoactive substance use worldwide, WHO experts developed the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST).","Management of substance abuse incorporates many components as it disrupts several aspects of an individual’s life. Addiction treatment must help the individual stop using drugs, maintain a drug-free lifestyle, and achieve productive functioning in the family, at work, and in society. Patients require long-term and repeated episodes of care to achieve the ultimate goal of sustained abstinence and recovery."
Scabies,"Scabies is one of the commonest dermatological conditions in the world. It is a parasitic skin infestation caused by a mite called Sarcoptes scabiei var hominis. The mite is so small that it is not visible to the naked eye. It burrows into the epidermis (top layer of skin), lays eggs, triggering a host immune response that leads to intense itching in response to just a few mites, (scabies is a Latin word that simply means to scratch). Scabies is a contagious disease primarily related to overcrowding and poverty. Scabies is transmitted from human to human by prolonged skin-to-skin contact with a person who has scabies.",Signs and symptoms of scabies include-,"Human scabies is caused by a mite (human itch mite) called Sarcoptes scabiei var hominis. The mite is very small, barely visible to the naked eyes.","Scabies can be diagnosed by the appearance of the skin, distribution of the rash and the presence of burrows and vesicles around the wrists and especially finger webs in adults and on the soles of the feet and ankles and sometimes the head in infants.","Primary management of scabies: The aim of treatment for scabies is to suppress the discomfort due to the disease, to limit the risk for secondary infection and related complications such as (heart and kidney disease), and to limit the dissemination of the disease in the family and more widely in the community."
Solar Retinopathy,"Solar retinopathy (photo-retinitis, foveomacular retinitis, photomaculopathy, or eclipse retinopathy) is the retinal injury induced by direct or indirect exposure to light. Harmful effects of viewing sun are well recognised. Solar retinopathy may be due to looking at solar eclipse with or without telescope, sunbathing, religious gazing of sun, and use of psychotropic drugs.",Mild photochemical damage may not be symptomatic in patients.,Retinal damage to light is produced by either breakdown of the intrinsic protective mechanisms of the eye and/or to the external high risk conditions.,"Diagnosis depends upon clinical history/symptoms, manifesting signs, and investigations.","In management, there is no specific therapy for solar retinopathy."
Steatoblepharon,"Steatoblepharon is the anterior prolapse of eyelid fat pad, due to weakening of orbital septum, resulting in a puffy appearance of the eyes. The eyelid fat pads play an important role in maintaining contour of eyelids. Eyelid fat provides fullness and smoothness to both upper and lower eyelids. Instead of prolapse, atrophy of eyelid fat may cause posterior sinking of eyelids resulting in involutional enophthalmos.",Patients present for cosmetic reasons.,"Steatoblepharon may be a familial condition in younger individuals, and is not associated with signs of ageing.","In the upper eyelid, the medial fat pocket is typically most prominent. Bulging in the lateral part of upper lid is primarily due to prolapsed lacrimal gland.",Management is primarily surgical. It is often combined with blepharoplasty.
Silicosis,"Silicosis is one of the most important occupational health illnesses in the world. It is a progressive lung disease caused by inhalation of silica over a long period of time. Silicosis is characterized by shortness of breath, cough, fever and bluish skin.","Silicosis is characterized by shortness of breath, cough, fever and bluish skin.","Silicosis is caused by exposure to crystalline silica. Silica (SiO2 / silicon dioxide) is combination of silicon and oxygen. Silicon is very reactive, does not remain in the element form but combines either with oxygen and forms free silica (SiO2) or with oxygen and other elements and forms silicates such as asbestos. Silica and silicates constitute the bulk of most kinds of rocks, clays and sands.","Person working in an occupation with exposure to inhaled silica or having non occupational exposure to silica with the symptoms like cough, phlegm, or breathing difficulty, or no symptoms (even working for long times) should be evaluated for silicosis.","As there is no cure for silicosis, prevention is still the best way to avoid the disease. Once diagnosis of silicosis is confirmed, management depends on the degree of lung damage."
Sub-Conjunctival Haemorrhage,"Sub-conjunctival Haemorrhage or Ecchymosis, a benign condition, is a common cause of conjunctival redness. It is characterised by painless acute redness due to bleeding underneath conjunctiva, in the absence of discharge or inflammation.The major risk factors are trauma or contact lens wearing in young patients, but in elderly, systemic vascular diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and arteriosclerosis are common.","Sub-conjunctival haemorrhage is usually asymptomatic and present as a flat sheet of homogeneous red colour having well- defined limits. The collection of bright smooth blood is confined to a sector of the bulbar conjunctiva, and is sharply demarcated at the limbus.",Sub-conjunctival haemorrhage is a very common condition.,Diagnosis of sub-conjunctival haemorrhage is mainly clinical.,"There is no approved therapy to accelerate the resolution of haemorrhage. It requires only reassurance to patient that haemorrhage will disappear in about two to three weeks, with blood turning from red to yellow before absorption."
Siderosis Bulbi,"Siderosis Bulbi is a degenerative and pigmentary change in the eye that follows intra- ocular retention of a foreign body containing iron. Its degree of severity and rate of development depend upon the content and location of iron. Large, more posteriorly situated, and ferrous intra-ocular foreign bodies have the worst prognosis. Histopathologically, siderosis shows accumulation of iron within metabolically active cells. Cells of corneal epithelium, pupillary constrictor muscle, lens epithelium, trabecular meshwork, pars plana and retinal pigment epithelium all may be affected.",Symptoms of Siderosis may include:,"Retained intraocular foreign body are common in open globe injuries, causing multitude of adverse problems, many of them leading to severe visual disability.",Diagnosis depends upon clinical history and examination.,Management entails removal of retained IOFB. Removal of IOFB may stop the progression of siderosis.
Tetanus,"Tetanus is a medical condition characterized by a prolonged contraction of skeletal muscle fibers. The primary symptoms are caused by tetanospasmin, a neurotoxin produced by the Gram-positive, rod-shaped, obligate anaerobic bacterium Clostridium tetani. The infection causes painful tightening of the muscles, usually all over the body. It can lead to ""locking"" of the jaw, which makes it impossible to open mouth or swallow. If this happens, person can die due to suffocation. It usually occurs when a flesh wound becomes contaminated. If it is not treated, tetanus may lead to complications, which can be fatal.",Stiffness in the jaws (lock jaw). Muscle spasms and stiffness can spread from jaw into neck and limbs over 24 to 72 hours. Other symptoms include:,"Tetanus is caused by the Clostridium tetani bacterium. Clostridium tetani spores can live outside the body and are widespread in the environment. They are commonly found in the manure of animals such as horses and cows, and in contaminated soil. After they enter the body, the tetanus bacteria quickly multiply and release tetanospasmin. This is a type of poison known as a neurotoxin. If tetanospasmin enters the bloodstream, it can spread around the body, causing the symptoms of tetanus to develop. Neurotoxins block the nerve signals that are sent from the brain to the spinal cord and then on to the muscles. This causes the muscle spasms and muscle stiffness associated with tetanus.","Usually, tetanus can be diagnosed through the symptoms. But with the symptomatic diagnosis, a spatula test is also performed to confirm the diagnosis.",There are two types of treatment for tetanus:
Thalassaemia,"It is a forms of inherited autosomal recessive blood disorder that originated in the Mediterranean region. In thalassemia, the disease is caused by the weakening and destruction of red blood cells. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. People in thalassemia make less hemoglobin and fewer circulating red blood cells than normal, which results in mild or severe anemia. Thalassemia will present as microcytic anemia which may be differentiated from iron deficiency anemia.",Symptoms of thalassemia are the same as anemia which include:,"Both α and β thalassemias are often inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, although this is not always the case. For the autosomal recessive forms of the disease, both parents must be carriers in order for a child to be affected. If both parents carry a hemoglobinopathy trait, there is a 25% risk with each pregnancy for an affected child. Genetic counseling and genetic testing is recommended for families that carry a thalassemia trait.",A physical exam may reveal a swollen (enlarged) spleen. Thalassaemia can be diagnosed using a blood test. A blood sample will be taken and sent to a laboratory for examination.,Treatment for thalassemia major is a lifelong process which requires different specialists to manage the complications of the condition.
Tuberculosis,"Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Tuberculosis commonly affects   the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. It  spreads from person to person through the air, when people who are infected with TB infection cough, sneeze or otherwise transmit respiratory fluids through the air.",Tuberculosis most commonly affects the lungs. Common symptoms of active lung TB   are:,"The main cause of TB is Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a small, aerobics, non motile bacillus. TB spread when a person with an active TB infection in their lungs coughs or sneezes and someone else inhales the expelled droplets containing TB bacteria.","Symptomatic Diagnosis: Coughing for more than 2 weeks, loss of weight, loss of appetite, fever and night sweats, fatigue are common symptoms of tuberculosis. If someone has these symptoms, one should seek medical advice to check whether it is tuberculosis.",Tuberculosis is completely curable.
Turners Syndrome,"Turner syndrome is a genetic condition that only affects females. It is a chromosomal abnormality in which all or part of one of the sex chromosomes is absent or has other abnormalities (unaffected humans have 46 chromosomes, of which two are sex chromosomes). In some cases, the chromosome is missing in some cells but not others, a condition referred to as mosaicism or Turner mosaicism","Short stature,Lymphodema (swelling) of the hands and feet,Broad chest (shield chest) and widely spaced nipples,Low hairline,Low-set ears,Reproductive sterility,Rudimentary ovaries,Amenorrhoea, or the absence of a menstrual period,Increased weight, obesity,Shield shaped thorax of heart,Small fingernails,Characteristic facial features,Coarctation of the aorta,Bicuspid aortic valve,Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder or ADHD (problems with concentration, memory, attention with hyperactivity seen mostly in childhood and adolescence),Nonverbal Learning Disability (problems with math, social skills and spatial relations)",Turner syndrome is a genetic condition caused by abnormal sex chromosomes.,Pre-natal tests:,"There is no cure for Turner syndrome, but many of the associated symptoms like short stature, sexual development problems and learning difficulties, can be treated."
Trichiasis,Trichiasis is an acquired condition characterised by posterior misdirection of previously normal eye lashes. The misdirected lashes may be diffuse involving the entire lid (diffuse trichiasis) or may involve a small segment of it (simple trichiasis). Simple trichiasis is relatively more common as compared to diffuse trichiasis.,Patient may present with symptoms like:,There are various causes of trichiasis:-,Diagnosis is based on history and clinical examination.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Trachoma,"Trachoma is a chronic keratoconjunctivitis caused by four ocular serotypes A, B, Ba and C of organism Chlamydia trachomatis. It is a disease of underprivileged populations living in poor conditions of hygiene.",Most of the individuals with trachoma are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms depending on the severity of inflammation. Symptoms in eye are similar to those seen in any chronic conjunctivitis and may include:-,"Trachoma is caused by repeated conjunctival infection with serotypes A, B, Ba and C of organism Chlamydia trachomatis. Chlamydiae are gram-negative obligate intracellular bacteria. The incubation period for trachoma is 5-12 days.",Diagnosis of trachoma mainly depends upon clinical presentation.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Toxic Keratoconjunctivitis,"Toxic keratoconjunctivitis or Toxic conjunctivitis may result from topical preparations for the treatment of ophthalmic conditions. Topical ophthalmic preparations can confuse the diagnosis of toxic keratoconjunctivitis. Medications often alleviate the symptoms initially and only at a later time, sometimes years after initiating therapy, will the patient develop discomfort. Common toxic agents are glaucoma medications, preservatives, antibiotics and antivirals. Patients with keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye syndrome) are particularly at risk.",Toxic keratoconjunctivitis may produce symptoms such as:,"There is no single mechanism responsible for drug intolerance or toxicity, but a combination of these occurs simultaneously, or in sequence and cause symptoms.","For the diagnosis of Toxic keratoconjunctivitis, a detailed clinical history is important. A common history is that the eye disease improved upon initial treatment, but the symptoms in eye worsened with continued use. Clinical manifestations resolve when the topical medication is discontinued.  Patients often do not communicate the routine use of over-the-counter (OTC) eye preparations, such as artificial tears or vasoconstrictors. Hypersensitivity reactions to topical ocular medications usually take place early in the course of treatment, but toxic reactions usually occur after prolonged use of drugs.",Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Thermal Injuries To The Eye,"Thermal injuries to the eye are potentially blinding eye injuries and constitute true emergencies. Thermal injuries to the eye are less common than chemical injuries, with very different forms of ocular insult, post-injury problems, and treatment approaches.",Symptoms may include:,"Thermal injuries result from accidents associated with firework explosion, steam, boiling water, or molten metal. Thermal burns include those caused by a flame, which are usually severe with deep tissue injury, and those caused by flash accidents, such as explosions or electrical arcs, which are usually more superficial but may be extensive. The thermal injury is immediate and non-progressive.",Patients with ocular thermal trauma should undergo early evaluation of the eye to assess the extent of the injury and exclude the possibility of an intraocular or intraorbital foreign body. The frequency of eye examination must balance the risk of ocular sequelae with the risk of contamination.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Terrien'S Marginal Degeneration,"Terrien’s Marginal Degeneration (TMD) is a slowly progressive, bilateral, peripheral corneal thinning disorder associated with corneal neovascularisation, opacification and lipid deposition. The disease is usually bilateral but may initially present in one eye. The cause of Terrien’s marginal degeneration is not known and patients may have high degrees of astigmatism. Up to about one third of patients may have associated episcleral or scleral inflammation. Patients are typically between 20-40 years of age, although it may present in childhood or in older people (age ranges from 10 to 70 years). It is more common in men than in women.",Patients are asymptomatic with initial mild disease.,The cause of Terrien’s marginal degeneration remains unknown. There are two types:,"The diagnosis of Terrien’s marginal degeneration is clinical, based on history, slit lamp (bio-microscopy) examination of the eye, and corneal topography.",Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Taeniasis/Cysticercosis,Taeniasis is an intestinal infection caused by adult tapeworms. Humans can get infected with two species of tapeworms-Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) and Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm). T.saginata has no major impact on human health while T. solium leads to neurocysticercosis-most severe form of the disease.,"A tapeworm infection does not always cause symptoms. Sometimes symptoms are mild and non-specific such as abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea or constipation. Symptoms may arise 6–8 weeks after ingestion of meat containing cysticerci; when the tapeworms become fully developed in the intestine. These symptoms may continue until the tapeworm dies following treatment, otherwise it may live for years.",Taeniasis is intestinal infection caused by two species of tapeworms Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) and Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm).,(a)  Examination of stool samples-Diagnosis of Taenia tapeworm infections can be made by examination of stool samples; Stool specimens should be collected on three different days and examined in the lab for taenia eggs using a microscope. Tapeworm eggs can be detected in the stool 2 to 3 months after the tapeworm infection is established.,"Treatment of taeniasis may include administration of praziquantel (single-administration) or niclosamide (single-administration) and if the patient has cysticercosis in addition to taeniasis, praziquantel should be used with caution. Praziquantel is cysticidal and can cause inflammation around dying cysts in those with cysticercosis, which may lead to seizures or other symptoms."
Typhoid / Enteric Fever,"Enteric fever, also known as typhoid, is a common worldwide bacterial disease caused by the ingestion of contaminated food or water which contain the bacterium Salmonella enterica enterica, serovarTyphi. It is very common in India. Symptoms usually develop one to two weeks after exposure, and may be mild or severe. Symptoms include high fever, malaise, headache, constipation or diarrhoea, rose-colored spots on the chest, and enlarged spleen and liver. Healthy carrier state may follow acute illness. Typhoid fever can be treated with antibiotics.","The symptoms of typhoid fever usually develop one to two weeks after a person becomes infected with the Salmonella typhi bacteria. The incubation period is usually one to two weeks, and the duration of the illness is about four to six weeks.",The bacteria that cause typhoid fever is S. typhi.,"Your doctor may look for symptoms and medical histroy, if he suspects typhoid. but diagnosis is generally confirmed by blood culture.","Medications: A fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin. A third-generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone orcefotaxime is the first choice. Cefixime is a suitable oral alternative. Antibiotics, such as ampicillin,chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin, have been commonly used to treat enteric fever."
Traumatic Hyphaema,Traumatic Hyphaema is the accumulation of blood in the anterior chamber of eye following trauma. Trauma is the most common cause of hyphaema. Traumatic hyphaema may occur following both blunt and penetrating injuries. A ruptured iris root blood vessel generally causes bleeding. Hyphaema may affect vision by blocking the visual axis. Hyphaema may also be a sign of associated damage to intraocular tissues. Damage to intraocular tissues may be the cause of poor vision in spite of resolution of hyphaema.,Symptoms may be,"Blunt trauma is the most common cause of hyphaema. Compressive force to the eye may damage iris, ciliary body, trabecular meshwork and their associated blood vessels. Shearing forces due to injury may tear away the blood vessels.","Clinical history and examination may help in identification of most hyphaemas. Upright posture of patient at an angle of 30° allows the hyphaema to settle at a fluid level. Size and shape of hyphaema is recorded daily, so as to assess its resolution or secondary haemorrhage, if it occurs. Daily assessment of visual acuity and pupillary reactions help in assessment of progress of medical management. Applanation tonometry to record intraocular pressure is deferred, unless elevated intraocular pressure is suspected. Fundus examination is also postponed till the media is clear, barring few exceptions. B- Scan can be done, if retinal detachment is suspected.",There is diversity of opinion regarding how to manage patients with traumatic hyphaema. Proper information of the current status and serious nature of injury to eye is the first step of management.
Trochlear Nerve Palsy,"Trochlear Nerve Palsy (Fourth Cranial Nerve Palsy) manifests as an isolated vertical, diagonal, or cyclo-torsional diplopia (double vision). It is worse on looking down and to the side opposite the lesion. In addition to the defect in eye movement, the affected eye produces characteristic head tilt away from the affected side. Fourth cranial nerve palsies are relatively uncommon. Isolated fourth cranial nerve palsy is the most common cause producing vertical diplopia. Trauma is the usual trigger of trochlear nerve palsy. In adults, isolated fourth cranial nerve palsy may occur due to infarction of peripheral trochlear nerve or because of monocular visual deprivation due to decompensation of asymptomatic congenital nerve palsy.",Patients with isolated trochlear nerve palsy may be asymptomatic.,The Causes of trochlear nerve palsy may be,Diagnosis depends upon the clinical features and the clinical tests.,Medical therapy:
Tooth Sensitivity,"Dentinal Hypersensitivity is commonly known as tooth sensitivity. If a person feels mild to severe discomfort or pain on consuming hot, cold, or sweet food and drinks or breathing in cold air, it indicates sensitive teeth. It is a very common clinical presentation and causes considerable concern for patients. Studies showed that in most populations, 10-30% of the general population suffer from dentinal hypersensitivity.",,"The tooth has outer enamel layer that protects the dentin underneath. The dentin comprises of microscopic tubules or canals that are connected to the pulp of the tooth. If dentin loses its protective covering of enamel its tubules get exposed. These tubules allow heat, cold or acidic foods to reach the nerves and cells inside the pulp of the tooth and the tooth becomes sensitive.",,
Tomato Fever,"Tomato Fever (Tomato Flu), a virus infection has emerged in India in the state of Kerala in children younger than 5 years of age. It was first identified in the Kollam district on May 6, 2022.Till date, this infection has been seen in the state of Orissa and Tamil Nadu, along with Kerala. Tomato fever is so called because of the eruption of red and painful blisters throughout the body that gradually enlarge to the size of tomato. Historically, Tomato fever cases were reported in past in the state of Kerala in the year 2007.","The primary symptoms observed in children with Tomato fever are similar to those of Dengue/Chikungunya. It includes general symptoms such as- Fatigue, Nausea, Vomiting, Diarrhoea, Dehydration, Body aches, and Common Influenza-like symptoms. Other symptoms include,","Due to the absence of substantial scientific literature, the exact cause of the outbreak is still under investigation.","Children are at increased risk of exposure to Tomato fever as viral infections are common in this age group and spread is likely to be possible through close contacts. Young children are also prone to this infection through touching unclean surfaces, putting things in mouth, or through use of nappies.","Since Tomato fever is similar to Chikungunya, Dengue, and HFMD; management is also similar like"
Tics And Eye Manifestations,"Tics are defined as repeated individually recognisable, movement fragments or intermittent movements that are almost always suppressible briefly and are usually associated with awareness of an urge to perform the movement. A tic is sudden, recurrent, rapid, non-rhythmic movement or vocalisation.",Tics may present with symptoms such as,Causes,Diagnosis of tics is usually based on clinical features,"Psychiatric intervention is normally not required. Tics may range in terms of severity and impairment, and treatment is required only if tics are a source of impairment and interfere daily life. Usual clinical practice is to focus initially on educational and supportive interventions."
Ulcerative Colitis,"It is a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Ulcerative colitis is a form of colitis, a disease of the colon (large intestine) that includes characteristic ulcers or open sores. Ulcerative colitis is similar to Crohn's disease, another form of IBD. Ulcerative colitis is an intermittent disease, with periods of exacerbated symptoms, and periods that are relatively symptom free. Ulcerative colitis is treated as an autoimmune disease.",These can vary depending on how much of the colon is affected and the level of inflammation. Common symptoms include,The exact cause of the disease   is unknown. But it is associated with autoimmune disorder which is a combination of genetic and environmental   factors:,To diagnose ulcerative colitis various tests are performed:,Aminosalicylates: Aminosalicylates are the first treatment option for mild to moderate ulcerative colitis.
Urticaria,Hives are red and sometimes itchy bumps on the skin. It is generally caused due to an allergic reaction to a drug or food. Allergic reactions cause body to release chemicals that can make skin swell up in hives. People who have other allergies are more likely to get hives than other people. Other causes include infections and stress.,"Appear as small round wheals, rings or patches and may change shape,Itching may be accompanied by a red flare,Often appear on the face or the extremities,Sometimes it  lasts from 30 minutes to 36 hours. As some patches disappear, new patches may develop","Urticaria is caused by the release of histamine and other chemicals from under the skin's surface, causing the tissues to swell.",Urticaria is generally diagnosed by looking at the rashes on the skin. Doctor may ask about the allergens and any medications.,It generally involves symptomatic relief. Various medications included are
Varicose Veins,"Varicose veins are swollen and enlarged veins, usually blue or dark purple in color. They may also be lumpy, bulging or twisted in appearance. They mostly occur in the legs. The blood is prevented from flowing backwards by a series of tiny valves that open and close to let blood through. If the valves weaken or are damaged, the blood can flow backwards and can collect in the vein, eventually causing it to be swollen and enlarged (varicose). This allows blood to flow backwards and they enlarge even more.",Varicose veins are dark purple or blue in color and are usually twisted and bulging in appearance. Some people with varicose veins may experience pain or discomfort. Symptoms of varicose veins can include:,Varicose veins are usually caused by weak vein walls and valves. Other risks factors involved are:,Varicose veins can rarely cause a serious condition and generally do not require treatment. Varicose veins is diagnosed by their appearance. Doctor may examine legs while patient is standing to check for signs of swelling.,"Varicose veins do not always need treatment. If varicose veins are not causing any discomfort, then person may not need to have treatment. If treatment is required:"
Vitamin B12 Deficiency,"Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia is a low red blood cell count due to a lack of vitamin B12. Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues.,Vitamin B 12 and folate,Vitamin B12 and folate together help the body produce red blood cells. They also have several other important functions:,Vitamin B12 keeps the nervous system (brain, nerves and spinal cord) healthy. Vitamin B12 is generally found in:,Dairy products,Folate is important for pregnant women because it reduces the risk of birth defects in unborn babies. The best source of folate is green vegetables such as:,Broccoli,Brussel sprouts,References:,http://icmr.nic.in/ijmr/2011/october/1004.pdf,http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Anaemia-vitamin-B12-and-folate-deficiency/Pages/Introduction.aspx,http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/b12/index.html,http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000574.htm","Symptoms of anemia vary depending on the underline cause:,Vitamin B12 deficiency/ pernicious anemia,If anemia is caused by a vitamin B12 deficiency, one may have symptoms like:,Yellow coloration of skin,A sore and red tongue (glossitis),Ulcers inside mouth,An altered sense of touch,Disturbed vision,Irritability,Depression,Psychosis,Dementia – a decline in mental abilities, such as memory, understanding and judgment,Folate deficiency,As well as general symptoms of anemia, a folate deficiency may also cause:,Loss of sensation, such as a reduced sense of touch or pain,Muscle weakness,Depression,Reference:,http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/b12/index.html","The exact cause is not known, but disease is associated with certain risks factors which include:,Age – Pernicious anemia is most common at later age,Gender – Pernicious anemia affects slightly more women than men,Family history – nearly a third of people with anemia also have a family member with the condition,Autoimmune condition, such as Addison’s disease or vitiligo – is also associated with anemia and other autoimmune conditions,Diet- The body generally stores vitamin B12 to last approximately two to four years. However, it is important to have vitamin B12 in the diet to ensure  the store is kept at a healthy level.,Conditions affecting the stomach- Some stomach conditions or stomach operations can also prevent the absorption of  vitamin B12. For example, a gastrectomy(a surgical procedure where part of stomach is removed) also increases risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency anemia.,Conditions affecting the intestines- Some conditions that affect intestines (part of the digestive system). For example, Crohn’s disease (a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system) can sometimes result in body not able to absorb enough vitamin B12.,Folate deficiency anaemia,Folate is a water-soluble vitamin (it dissolves in water), as a result body is unable to store it for long periods of time. Body stores folate that last four months. This means one need folate in daily diet to ensure body has sufficient stores of the vitamin.,Diet- Not having enough folate in daily diet.,Mal absorption- Sometimes body is unable to absorb folate as effectively as it should. This is usually the result of an underlying condition affecting digestive system, such as Coeliac disease.,Excessive urination- Body may lose folate from body if one urinate frequently. This can be caused by an underlying condition that affects one of the organs, such as your kidneys or liver.,Pregnancy- If a women is pregnant or planning to get pregnant, daily supplement of 0.4mg of folic acid should be taken for at least  12 weeks.,Reference:,http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Anaemia-vitamin-B12-and-folate-deficiency/Pages/Causes.aspx","Diagnosis may require a complete blood count or peripheral blood smear based on patient history and physical examination.,Reference:,http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/b12/detection.html",Treatment mainly depends upon the underlying conditions for the anemia:
Vitiligo,"It is a condition that causes pale, white patches to develop on skin (de pigmentation of the skin). Vitiligo can affect any area of  the skin, but most commonly occurs on skin exposed to the sun, such as   face, neck and hands. The condition varies from person to person.,It occurs when melanocytes, the cells responsible for skin pigmentation, die or are unable to function. The cause of vitiligo is unknown, but research suggests that it may arise from autoimmune, genetic, oxidative stress, neural, or viral causes.","Vitiligo is flat, white spots or patches on the skin.,Lesions are  hypo pigmented. Patients   are stigmatized for their condition and may experience depression and similar mood disorders.","Vitiligo is caused by the lack of a skin pigment called melanin. It may be further associated with the conditions:,Autoimmune Conditions:,Non-segmental vitiligo, the most common type of vitiligo, is thought to be an autoimmune condition. This means that the immune system (the body’s natural defense system) does not work properly. Instead of attacking foreign cells, such as viruses, immune system produces antibodies (infection-fighting proteins) that attack the body’s own healthy cells and tissue.,Neurochemicals:,Segmental vitiligo, the less common type of vitiligo, is thought to be caused by chemicals released from the nerve endings in the skin. These chemicals are poisonous to the melanocyte skin cells.",Vitiligo can usually be diagnosed   by physical examination    done by a physician.,"There is no specific cure for the disease. However, skin's appearance can be stored with the help of certain treatments."
Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis,"Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) or spring catarrh is a chronic, recurrent, bilateral, at times asymmetrical, seasonally exacerbated external ocular inflammation affecting children and young adults. VKC usually begins before the age of 10 years. It generally resolves around puberty, usually about 4-10 years after onset and only rarely may persist beyond the age of 25 years.","Patients with VKC may have several episodes of active inflammation throughout the year, but symptoms are characteristically worse during spring and summer.","The exact aetiology and pathogenesis is still not clear, although allergic nature of this disease is being accepted for long. Role of genetic predisposition and environmental factors in onset, its progression and resolution of this self-limiting disease, is not clear.","Diagnosis of VKC is based upon typical clinical features, thus many mild or atypical cases may escape diagnosis. Lack of standardised diagnostic criteria regarding the severity of VKC renders this disease more difficult to diagnose and manage.",Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Whooping Cough/Pertussis,"Whooping cough is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs. It is also known as pertussis. Pertussis is known for uncontrollable, violent coughing which often makes it hard to breathe. After fits of many coughs, someone with pertussis often needs to take deep breathes which result in a ""whooping"" sound. Pertussis most commonly affects infants and young children and can be fatal, especially in babies less than 1 year of age.",The classic symptoms of whooping cough are:,"Whooping cough is caused by a bacterium called Bordetella pertussis. The bacterium infects the lining of the airways, mainly the windpipe (trachea) and the two airways that branch off from it to the lungs (the bronchi). The symptoms of whooping cough usually take between six to twenty days to appear after infection with the bordetella pertussis bacterium. This delay is known as the incubation period.",Laboratory diagnosis: It include culturing of nasopharyngeal swabs on Bordet-Gengou medium,
West Nile Fever,"West Nile fever is a zoonotic disease (an animal disease affecting humans). Disease is caused by West Nile virus (WNV), which is a flavivirus related to the viruses that cause St. Louis encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, and yellow fever. West Nile virus is mainly transmitted to people through the bites of infected mosquitoes. WNV is maintained in nature by transmission between birds and mosquitoes; as birds are the natural hosts of the virus. Humans, horses and other mammals can be infected.",The incubation period (the period between exposure to an infection and the appearance of the first symptoms) of WN fever is usually 3 to 14 days.,"West Nile fever is caused by West Nile virus (WNV), belongs to the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) antigenic complex under family flaviviridae.",Various diagnostic tests are-,Specific antiviral treatment for West Nile virus infection is not available. In mild infection pain relievers can be used to reduce fever.
Welding-Arc Maculopathy,"Welding-arc maculopathy may develop following prolonged exposure to welding arc radiation without adequate protection of eyes. It generally affects young people because of their occupational lack of knowledge and also due to presence of relatively clear ocular media. Most common injury with welding arc radiation is photophthalmia due to ultraviolet (UV) light absorption. Welding-arc maculopathy may be underreported because of its transient clinical features, which may be masked by associated photokeratitis.",Symptoms include,Mechanism,"Diagnosis depends upon the clinical history, clinical features, and investigative procedures.",There is no effective therapy for welding-arc maculopathy.
Xanthelasma,"Xanthelasma (xanthelasma palpebrarum) is a raised, yellow, soft, plaque-like, velvety lesion most commonly seen in the medial canthal (inner junction between upper and lower eyelid) area of the eyelid. It is a common subcutaneous eyelid lesion. It tends to be bilateral and is more common in the elderly. It has slightly more female preponderance. Xanthelasma is known to occur as a result of hyperlipidaemia, hypercholesterolemia, obesity and cardiovascular diseases. Although some patients with xanthelasma have normal lipid levels, others may show hyperlipidaemia (usually type II) or secondary hyperlipidaemia owing to conditions such as biliary cirrhosis or diabetes mellitus.",Patients present with Xanthelasma on the lids thereby disfiguring the face.,The aetiology of xanthelasma is not known.,Diagnosis is usually clinical.,Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Xerophthalmia,"Xerophthalmia is a condition of early vitamin A deficiency in which cornea keratinises, become opaque and forms dry, scaly layers of cells. Affected cornea is susceptible to infection. The conjunctiva may keratinise and develop plaques known as Bitot’s spots.  In1863, Pierre Bitot, a French physician, first described these spots.",Symptoms of vitamin A deficiency are associated with the requirement of vitamin A for the maintenance of epithelial functions.,"There are low levels of vitamin A in plasma, liver, and extra-hepatic tissues of neonates, as compared to adults. Normal plasma levels increase gradually as child grows.","Diagnosis depends upon history, clinical examination and laboratory investigations.",Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Yellow Fever,"Yellow fever is a serious viral infection that is   spread by a   mosquito known as the Aedes aegypti mosquito. The causative agent is virus   of the Flavivirus genus. Yellow fever mainly occurs in sub-Saharan Africa (countries to the south of the Sahara desert), South America and in parts of the Caribbean.",Incubation period of yellow fever is   3-6 days. Symptoms occur in 2 stages:,"Yellow fever is caused by a type of virus known as a flavivirus. The infection is transmitted by the bite of certain mosquitoes. If one is travelling, developing risks of yellow fever will depend on:",Yellow fever is usually diagnosed based on the symptoms and the results of a blood test.,"There is no specific treatment for yellow fever. However, symptoms can be relieved by symptomatic treatment."
Yaws,,There are two basic stages of yaws: early (infectious) and late (non-infectious).,"Yaws is caused by Treponema pertenue which closely resembles to T.pallidium. It is a slender spirochete that is serologically indistinguishable from the spirochete T.pallidium which causes syphilis. The agents found in the epidermis of the lesions, lymph glands, spleen and bone marrow. The organism rapidly dies outside the tissues.","Yaws simulates the lesions of scabies, impetigo, skin tuberculosis, tinea versicolor, tropical ulcer, leprosy and psoriasis. It may also accompany these diseases. Penicillin treatment is very useful in differential diagnosis because of miraculous relief seen in yaws but not in other skin diseases.","Two antibiotics are recommended for the treatment of Yaws by WHO. Persons having any features/ symptoms suggestive of Yaws in endemic areas should consult nearest Government Health facility for confirmation and treatment of Yaws. India has eliminated Yaws in September 2006, 3 years after the last case was detected. Now the country is aiming to achieve yaws eradication."
Zika Virus Disease,"Zika virus disease is an emerging mosquito borne viral disease. It is transmitted by bite of an infected Aedes mosquito. Zika virus was first identified in Zika forest of Uganda in 1947 in rhesus monkeys. In1952, it was identified in humans, in Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania through serological tests. The virus was isolated from human samples in Nigeria in 1968. Outbreaks of Zika virus disease have been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific.","A majority of those infected with Zika virus disease either remain asymptomatic (up to 80%) or show symptoms  similar to other arbovirus infections such as dengue, and include fever, skin rashes, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain, malaise, and headache.",Zika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus closely related to dengue virus.,"Zika virus infection should be suspected in patients reporting with acute onset of fever, maculo-papular rash and arthralgia, among those individuals who travelled to areas with ongoing transmission during the two weeks preceding the onset of illness.","There is no specific antiviral treatment for Zika virus. Symptomatic treatment is advised after excluding more severe conditions such as malaria, dengue, and bacterial infection with the consultation of medical personnel. It is important to differentiate Zika virus infection from dengue because of severe complications in some dengue cases. In addition, co-infection with Zika and dengue could occur."
